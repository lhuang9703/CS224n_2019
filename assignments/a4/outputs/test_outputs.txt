You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in America.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can tell you as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell in somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom room.
He made it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a <unk> and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never came to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to tell you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were looking at it, and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and they took us from his family, because he was necessary, because he needed to.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to be <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed -- it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about it was done in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her back.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs a truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can very quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
The <unk> to my surrounding water was almost 60 feet and I wasn't able to think that it was a snowflake a snowflake about another snowflake year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or they break into the ice.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up and hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> passion.
It's easy to think, by seeing a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, largely as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As an iceberg melts it releases freshwater rich in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I walk to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Some of the ice in the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from an iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to get really to witness a <unk> iceberg actually.
Here they are.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg for average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one -- a baby <unk>
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if you stop to think about conception -- yes, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined by the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm is joined by the X chromosome.
Both <unk> and the life begins.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity of the ground, I would have two <unk>
And in one of my roles I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people are going to have the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role to performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics will not fit into the male generation and human <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
The <unk> takes a lot of shapes.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not engaged in the common or male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life that will become <unk>
And then in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
Is Capgras syndrome to the <unk>
So, there are high testosterone levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops following a single course of the <unk>
When you look at the baby it looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
After I did tests you realize that instead of having ovaries and life; it actually has testicles and an y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a woman who doesn't know his <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a <unk> 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he was wearing a life like a kid and he had just figured out he had ovaries and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had the 20th and the uterus of the uterus in the uterus, the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormonal environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormonal component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> no one got anything.
And it was at 19 years when he started to have caused medical problems caused by internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, it was women inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with different chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know how much that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> and they are committed to surgeries -- it's not in order to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they are in several surgeries is that they are a threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings to a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity <unk> being black means having African anatomy in historic terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very close ideas in our culture to the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people inside the same body.
The most recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in <unk> their sex on the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called them to wonder, "What do you test to do to determine whether to <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to journalists who don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more of science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought were <unk> <unk> categories that will spread directly with <unk> categories.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out far more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we get involved in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> probably are too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human, and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to engage with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still, they didn't get it.
If you stopped moving the <unk>
But today, for example, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to address the dilemma of determining really someone's death, and that puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy as I am.
In politics I'm progressive, to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
I think that these categories are much more fragile than we were going to be comfortable with.
It will come from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical and so radical and so radical in what they did, I find myself looking at that musical <unk> and not the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a generic concept, and they would put it up with another which was radical and beautiful and remained for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming up with political power by the right of blood passed away from the grandfather and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They set up the game camp and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the differences, but that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power that would be passed on a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at, for example, the Declaration of Independence, <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And the women.
Then it came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people of <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the Civil Rights Movement and saying, "I'm a man.
So again, people in color that we prescribe to <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep a certain <unk>
But attention -- I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we need to ask ourselves to anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five-year-old kids were supposed to allow them to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time, June 1, 1980.
Well, Henry, the other hand, was born in term, was the March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that he was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sex consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Well, Henry, in virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered to be considered to be a <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for your part, has no rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So I still do <unk> categories that in many ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science worked so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be taught.
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is sort of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome, and to get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests with people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you about the beginning of the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I am offered a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks like a good thing.
But in practice, how do you do this?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm also not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to do it for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make intelligent choices and <unk> about their sexual relations than people from 40 I know.
So how do I put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asked what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to continue to lead this stream of thinking in relation to democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian man who a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to less than he is willing to belong to a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that he had done a couple of years ago that he had done a couple of <unk> twins to then pick up their <unk>
But when the telephone I asked the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, I told you that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum instead of separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change for the sake of state.
So I think we need to be in the head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given greater involvement to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different things, particularly if there are people thinking in a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in looking at sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and working in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that the women on average, not all of all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships, and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, I was in graduate school, one of my consultants who knew I was interested in Feminism -- I thought I was interested as a <unk> he made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the youngest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there is nothing women in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, more has seemed to me that there is something women in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the <unk> were really excited to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that, to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we look at democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we are far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth a lot more than its construction cost.
So we could easily decode the world -- perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But it just goes through the apartments.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartment -- they were owners and that the other half is still going to be allowed to do this.
They could try to increase the ability to increase in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have norms to avoid the dinner as the development of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a building of <unk> and totally new apartments -- always and when the rules of that place to build the construction instead of building <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to raise new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask the United States what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following regular elections, <unk> <unk> has been seduced by a platform for the reforms of reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> her head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, such as those rules that say you can't go and annoy all of the current people in apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it is needed as much of technologies like rules to <unk> and usually they're the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link to the TEDTalk.
He showed it to <unk>
They called me off.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, a conference room from a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if you want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way our country forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport cover more than 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that was built by at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away north.
And we also need new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of government would need help of <unk> countries could benefit from countries associated with their countries that would help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that they can all rely on the <unk> so that they can actually benefit from the <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily take a thousand square miles.
And shortly afterwards, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and to add a constitutional available that allowed to create these special special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this criminal crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional woman was <unk> to one.
Everybody <unk> all the <unk> the <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 it passed another time in another voting to <unk>
Immediately after the voting on the age of 21, at 24 of February, a delegation of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is being built in Korea, it's bigger than the middle of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years by getting the <unk>
The other country in the building in cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this as practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second town.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators <unk> and it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the ultimate <unk>
There are <unk> and environmental developers who are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already figured out is they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to work with work, and they are sometimes single mothers that have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who have not seen, in some decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
So this is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find these, and more recently, photographing and publish and post in my blog, colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I'm going to like the color <unk>
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
It was inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after I got here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED <unk> --  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> the color is an energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible for bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the people in the right people, you don't just give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that we carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the <unk> or I remind you to their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at it that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be interested to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another suit. <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart, and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So, if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people -- that just like most of the other quantum physical physicists -- we need quite a lot of logical physical physics, these really complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves to play with them and then we see as usual, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a <unk> of intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is what it says that one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking room.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that the playing play with that parking bar taught him a very valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow you to get them down, and I stay in a place.
This is a huge conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play car bars -- they're playing with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics theory.
So at that point was the physics of a few years -- you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit even to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I should not all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
So a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's found right at the center.
And then here we make a very big approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, a way of springboard and that <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost about the same way that you would a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip. And I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> with a swimming way of swimming on the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum note, but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable is to be in a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up trying to do those things, because I don't want you to stop it, or, in fact, you <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> on inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to <unk> to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their motions.
We found out that he moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way it was -- it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and not just take it at the same time -- something that happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time that those same atoms are moving up to up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
You take the death penalty in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal piece is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would you be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we got it, and we turned out the lights and we looked into the box, and we saw that metal was still in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects in the elevator actually are quantum objects that are just embedded in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you -- they literally define who you are, and that's the profound strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing a little job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
Lots of negotiations and stories, you know, <unk> with 17 very interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story explains simply on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I was afraid of a great education -- I was not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than shows the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I actually go into one of my favorites, by the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are in the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and you <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and with one click, we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the hall,
Come forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, you click out there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information about <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, about 10,000 billion left.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 billion left.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression is no price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems to me.
I came up and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called called <unk> which is <unk> a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little perspective, I'm going to take the image, and you'll see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Van actually created this piece of <unk>
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time for <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create its own museum, to create its own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just made a zoom in.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my opinion, it's not come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media does justice to its work of art, and that is represented online online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a flying pixel around.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, all the children in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that there's something very interesting in the race of year and one in the last two decades.
For some time, if you wanted to win a career in a year of year -- one, take a budget and put it down to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough -- you gained the race.
This is what engineering, in engineering, are going to control over real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What is interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting back to the open.
And, as <unk> they're beginning to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> To <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms that are coming back and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old <unk> <unk>
You know, as Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end of the <unk> and he threw him in the Moses --  -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> non <unk> -- and what don't you say?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and drive something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of you remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day watching activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before play.
The timeline.
At the early early there are people here, and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
People are doing a quick call and they go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, <unk>
That night everybody went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winner of the winner and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody gets down.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the age of <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the trees of our objects.
So this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, what it looks like.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small labels to track the trash on their shift through the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage and then start <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there are lots of needed.
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still on there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote any change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something that we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology look like technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> which are open and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with water pixels of water.
If they fall down the pixels -- you can write them patterns, show patterns, images, <unk>
And when the curtain was going to open up so we can see it as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
I liked it a lot.
And <unk> a commission to design the building to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors no windows, but when you come up with it so you can get it to happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or can you close the building and all of the architecture to be on this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when they go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it <unk> but when you go down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see people who are going on in the inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to leave it when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you let it happen, but a building that kept making cuts and holes in water and you had to jump out for not wet.
And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things, that people use it.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water and projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each had a little pixel in which changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position of the pixel up.
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D <unk> to the one that you can get anywhere up and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light turns out, you see this. What we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of <unk> in today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's both <unk> 3D in real time like motion capture.
You can scratch all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and motion with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> farm like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last couple of decades, is that, in the last two decades, we move from the physical world into the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, of the power of creating the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are gone.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered up.
You can move inside the inside, have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, serving the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a way of connecting with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go out there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I told you that, with just some changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for more accurate accurate, more exact and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in the best way, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure of themselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it that you most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose anything?
<unk> from Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many to choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about the <unk>
It makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this, the world would be very different.
It's just important.
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED Conference, but I want to give you a look at a doctor about the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing called <unk> in biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if they actually embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Is it about other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is, of course, that we care.
It was a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
We have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in its most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is the same protein, which is what comes out of the pancreatic side.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry in our gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> does this thing about <unk> think about the contents.
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that they can want no effort in their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria to the occasional <unk> of any rush rush to the way.
But by the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients from <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only human life, and a little human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell just divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two <unk> cells.
But when organisms come out, things are beginning to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the entire genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body is going into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year it was happening, every time I had more doubt.
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas is in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
And in front of him you find a slight slight dancer.
He looks at him and he says, <unk> look for a <unk> of <unk>
It's good," she says, George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to pass the genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation generation after generation.
From a evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody <unk> the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily matter the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even even more clever.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only time for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish dry in empty fish and yet have managed to make that an informal environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we looked forward, at the time we look forward, at the time stage, I would say there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying principle would be that by medicine, first of all, we've been known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and 15 of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment in order to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we would make sure that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation of evolution to happen.
A second possibility is that there's a natural kind of evolution that is dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution can roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when as a species, distant planets are going to exist and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, one possibility and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> to us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Think about it if we could also be able to choose not just the sex of their <unk> but in their own body <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce cancer risk or eliminating the <unk>
Don't you want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
In the next year of being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near the 20,000 and a week.
Not much to make a lot of the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more to the reach of all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin can make viruses that are not just going to protect us from themselves, but that they're going to induce these other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental essay on course with the vaccine against flu -- in a plant of tobacco plants.
You can imagine something nice that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just another two little two <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but they can change the cells in their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or changing the <unk> egg -- and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminating diabetes eliminating the <unk> reduce their risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that the same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are also going to be able to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you were able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> <unk> faster than you can run faster and more <unk>
Why can't we live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of setting this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful society, more <unk>
Or, let's go to selectively selectively attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about all: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do is, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day.
It was the only one I could speak with flight <unk>
And so I looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably have some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, it's not the road.
You have the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and not noise.
And then he said three words.
The three other words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before he died -- these things that we want to do in life, and I didn't think about all the people I wanted to get in and did not all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further forward, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is ready there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to know anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is when I went to the bridge George Washington, which was not for a lot -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my errors have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also realized that my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I was talking about things that didn't care with people who matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my wife, with friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> at that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have the reason -- <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be done in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I went, I had the feeling of, I have a feeling of, I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  and I scream, <unk> like a small one.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understood that two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
Why the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
A miracle gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and to live in another way.
You guys who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please don't be like this -- but you can imagine, and how do you start?
What is it that you are still expecting to do because you think you're going to live forever.
How would your relationships change and negative energy.
And most importantly, they're being the best parents than <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with lots of projects.
But the oldest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis now.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation and so, obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went out and I met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all of the people in paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're a good person and you have a pretty good insurance not to do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way -- they go with <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to get a check and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I got dressed up with his brother and father in that precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it is ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inside cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- which have a technology that allows you to project a light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer that are drawn on that and register the negative space.
So they're going around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks at Bush and at the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a year later, after a lot of the organization and a lot of moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies, and we got a machine to make a machine that would be <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers out of the whole world of <unk> all the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, and I went back to the garage back and these hackers and the hackers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken out the frames of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the confines of <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap sun glasses that we bought on the board of <unk> Beach, some circle of copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and then you build one of the device -- we published the open-source code, the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says <unk>
There is no hospital that I can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a planning year of planning two weeks of treating intense sessions from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and he's looking through the support system.
I ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside of the hospital.
And he went back to drawing his family and friends -- you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to look at the parking lot so we felt like we were looking at graffiti as well.
And at the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time to be in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and get me out of there so that I could get it.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how better we can do it and make it faster and <unk>
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: If you look at something that is not possible -- do it possible.
None of the things that there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and I was excited to get some wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do, if it's not now, <unk> And if I am not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations mostly very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- a lot of fun in the middle, which is very dangerous in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career I've been <unk> in terrible situations with the only goal to treat. The only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully analyzing a way that you see fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some can have heard of them or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some of them on Twitter, offered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could come up in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company on it.
But said this, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked him a year ago, I would have no chance for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world <unk> world.
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be solved for something as difficult or so dangerous as to enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to <unk> products, and marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> movie is that everything up to the bottom, from beginning to end, has a brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the title of the title of the title, <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were spreading by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> In <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> It was more for <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure that we will put all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe and you get the oldest shoe you've got <unk>
The most great car you've driven on "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink you've ever <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the markings as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Doing <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is complete transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That is the full idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that that's the most respect for the audience.
And yet, I don't know how <unk> it is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big markings
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we would look at a lot like a whole bunch of fucking <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But being hard to <unk> by the film or for me.
JK:
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
And so I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product as many people as possible, to make so much people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the <unk> scenario is not the idea to be able to tell with that new vehicle that is worth of attention that is going to lead to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>    This is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free or easily <unk> easily <unk> or easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>  Like this weird road path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
It was a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> history.
We want it to take a story, but we want to <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was struck by some lie -- and there he is looking at me as a single <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, and it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to remove the proxy and go to companies myself.
So what I started to suddenly come up with -- and that I started to figure out is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giants and others who make small, independent movies, such as mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies -- giants, say that the reason that their films have so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm out there, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you get to you."
Maybe you should put in a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much a man like for <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the overall picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look.
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of movies smaller than <unk> we are rather a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget they have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind people to be the reason that we care about.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you fresh forward to better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common type.
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Volunteer: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good clothes.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like brown colors, many gray colors and things like this.
Usually I wear accessories like <unk> or the <unk> I like <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.
They put toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: You know, <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> in that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come out, and they start in a place and in my case where they come up and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is this was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird things.
A: <unk> the <unk> for what does that do us?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important <unk> What does the <unk>
So let's take a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, who is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be frightened. So what kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all of this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides that are two different sides of it, but it would be on your personality personality -- brand Morgan <unk> is a brand <unk>
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some businesses are only engaged in one of their strong points or elsewhere instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it's the nature of trying to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands all those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand. What is your <unk>
If somebody asks you to <unk> your brand, your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more an <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of the attributes are like being playful will be cool as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or are you rather than <unk> <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated as <unk>
You are -- traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You are <unk> stable, familiar -- safe, sacred <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had more than 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the end product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the desire centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing as a movie for a film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there are no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way to the schools with working problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I've had most success is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took off their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to challenge people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And what has he gone? They had this success?
Well, since the movie was sent back into the <unk> <unk>
According to <unk> the film came back in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks ago.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talk about is to tell their customers not to be <unk>
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks that there is opportunities.
I think when you pull out people that are pushing them to the failure.
I think when you train their employees in averse to the risk of being preparing their whole company to get out of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we're going to move forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
More than ever a bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And saying that, with transparency, and transparency, all my talk <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a phenomenal question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix -- the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my aid for TED <unk>
The idea behind the Gordian worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes you see are in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause lots of problems with a centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a effective virus from Windows to a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're ready.
This is the plan.
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray box hurts the <unk> and the nuclear nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, right?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started doing research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were going to put our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they got very strange stuff.
<unk> <unk> as a rat rat didn't like our <unk> the <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And then to experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that place: <unk>
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Make the goal soon.
And so we've got pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two motor bombs -- a small and a big.
We also saw that they were very biased by people who obviously had all the internal information.
You get all the points for you to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the load is very complex.
It's very much over everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at the beginning were called the system functions because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and we were looking at it and we were looking at it with the real world, with potential real world goals.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, which is that it's definitely a violent, violent, must be a white valuable, and it's probably probably in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
You don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the plant nuclear power plant and the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them into an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers, so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts calls stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A pretty <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had in between.
So there was no <unk> not like that.
The results have been from after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> at dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> came to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- I was really excited about.
There's the gray box and up the top, you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> which is still running during the attack, with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding <unk>
Is it great huh?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open escape escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can get bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, by <unk> with <unk> of uranium.
It could also work as well, for example, in an energy plant, or in an automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that spread this burden on a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
<unk> as much as possible.
And if you look at that, with what you're going to do, is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we want to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are a lot of targets.
We need to face the implications, and better than we start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public made in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is Project <unk>
There's one case, and that's the United States, hopefully <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give up <unk> skills or another to make users of chairs up and go back and go and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something that you put in the morning, gives you a big force, that also increases its speed, and aid, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But it's not just that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and other things like that.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier who, on average, must carry on your back a load of 45 pounds, and it's being <unk> to bring even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can get 90 pounds through variables for a lot of hours.
Their computer design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
So what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of the <unk> about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with a very young people, with the damage in the column that when their life will -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is happening that will be pretty quickly.
Her only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had a spinal cord injury and as a result could not go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors -- it has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> on the crutches that sends signals onto board, here on the back.
And there are some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move forward with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger in the air, skiing down the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and all movement from <unk> down.
Shortly after later, a doctor went into my room at the hospital, and he said, "You will never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole my way up to the last hint of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology to sit down and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of the <unk> to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex in order to say hello, and play is the order of the day, where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Man of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the forests of the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where death violence has not been observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the <unk>
<unk> meat and deforestation are making you can't fill with a stadium with the bonobos who stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden -- hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes -- the <unk> not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, and for us the game is fundamental to make ties and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the play game that you see the roots of the <unk> the same of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual of life.
The game is the glue that brings us together.
I don't know how you play you but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild medium.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> it has <unk>
I just think in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual play is both common in Bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are most <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female -- who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the boundaries of our inner and outside worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To deal with a world that changes we have to play.
But let's go through the maximum our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk> life.
When it seems to be the least appropriate thing to play, it can be the times that it is most urgent to be.
And so, fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as we get creativity, the friendship and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for developing a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of the captain in a fire market.
And in our city, where the volunteers will come to a highly <unk> staff has to get to the <unk> site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But still, there was a career in foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that surely went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and his house was in flames.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> --   he got first to the captain and he asked him to go in and would save the dog's dog.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, he would have to tell people who entered a <unk> building to save a live live just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go between the house.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of <unk>
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I jumped on the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen who had just finished the fire -- and the fire went down to the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog at the front door.
<unk> from the house with the house owner where, as they would expect, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the house owned by the <unk> <unk> to save her home.
The kindness that she observed by the other was someone had had even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as a volunteer fireman I witnessed generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or they're by making -- remarkable levels of success -- I'd like to remind you this: I don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody.
If you have something to give, it will come now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of cement from a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit of building in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> it came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 products per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
It was simply adopted the concrete block -- the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> world, stacked up a few other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete, concrete block allows the transistor to create much bigger circuits and more complex brick at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're linked through magnets.
So they can't be placed in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> blue is the stream, pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble blue with a green one, and you can very quickly start to make bigger circuits here.
A blue blue one is producing light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
We have this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to be able to connect and connect and <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures to it.
To make you faster or faster, you just spin this button which makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it is a single collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to move to bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar cells, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that they don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light work work? You know, why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also taken care to design schools.
So, for example, designers without any electronic experience of electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> the designers at Rhode Island School of Island, which have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the dark.
For these people not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach out of all.
That's why <unk> has open source.
You can go to the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So ahead and up.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discovery.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment.
The collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
We can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to be on time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a bunch of Peace <unk>
Some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send it to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
Meet <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it comes up as if I would look at a quote, but what really looks for is that someone is caught up when you were caught up the snow because you know it's not very good by putting <unk> when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to help ask for help in this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a long year last year.
They realized that the city has never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that <unk> citizens with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
It may be the smallest of 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the Afghan government.
And it spreads viral.
A responsible for <unk> systems to see this app realized that I could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why he asked the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that would use using it.
And this has spread without <unk> it is organic and natural.
If you know a little government technology -- you know this doesn't happen.
The acquisition of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they have done it by the normal channels have taken at least two years and two million dollars about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California in California that has been over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is program in a couple of days and it spreads into viral form is a kind of a shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the government better ways to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think that it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in form open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of dealing with the issue of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications that are <unk> every day in their own communities.
They have no given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration and they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they are going to make us nuts, the government is essentially in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
The politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made up of -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking about it will affect the way of producing change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the heart of services and information and information.
It's the place that the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
I joined the core of official knowledge.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, and put it very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that's not the end of the <unk>
Boston has no call center.
It has a resolution and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened to get this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report would say, "I come up to the place, I found the bucket of crap behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, <unk> <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to volunteer willful collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people are going to be <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected to the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps another, they will bring their communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think you're the entry from the other.
That our entry to the government system is a vote.
How many times have we chosen a leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will take our values and make our values, but then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like a huge ocean and politics is the shallow layer of 15 feet.
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what that keeps us from that that is that we funded as something that we actually funded as something that is working on our against, that one thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work we will have to make the bureaucracy <unk>
Because it's where the real business work happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not financial activism that is activism <unk>
And for the ones that we have moved to the government, it's time for us to ask our children to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't get out of government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act on, we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old so that I, and I am a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to speak, everyone will talk.
They can express their opinions on any channel at the same time and they do.
So when the government problem facing the government of the government don't really care about their voices.
They're using their hands.
They give the work to work to program applications that make the government better for the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a fire hydrant, taking away a little bit of crap that has a <unk> inside.
And of course, we were able to have <unk> those <unk> and lots of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, not only consumers that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get to <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these stimulation has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach you feeling, you can have special meaning can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up at a traditional house of a African-American African-American family for a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard to be strong, it was power.
It was the last word in the whole discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born about <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was small and watching her, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was feeling so hard that I could barely breathe and then I <unk>
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> and I was going to go back and say, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was going back again, and if I told him that yes, I left me in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to pick up your time and your attention.
My cousins was running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her and he was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 to 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, he took my hand out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. Let's get the two to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said to me, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I know I didn't do it. I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just I want you to give me three things, you know?
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, I think <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right thing -- even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never have to be <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the rural rural <unk> I have a bigger brother and sister a year.
When I was 14 to 15, one day my brother came home with a package of six <unk> I don't know where <unk> grabbed us to my sister and me, and we went to the forest.
We just got to be doing <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he gave my sister, she took my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. Do you guys -- but I'm not going to take a <unk>
My brother said, <unk> Today you will. And you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I landed my look at the strength and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking it's a <unk> I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the other that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe you to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to it, we should be <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In the United States, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One in three black <unk> between 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> throughout the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Australia, Washington, 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all the color in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that comes up much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth but wealth which affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem.
We are <unk>
I think it looks interesting.
We're looking at our work some kind of developments well curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you accept rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before they went to the vote of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he sentence children from 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without any chance to go out.
Right now, we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They encourage people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, we've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine people who have identified that it's innocent that it's <unk> and liberated from death row.
An innocent mistake, was an innocent in each nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it wouldn't be allowed to fly planes if in every nine that you would have, you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history <unk>
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The threat of the terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are people older than come to me, and they say, "Mr. Stevenson, you have a conversation about it: <unk> people who stop saying that in our own history, for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
<unk> went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically understood what we've historically done.
All of the time we get to do with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
We need to work to talk about races. I think it's because we are not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome race racially without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's good disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There's no way for our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, intentional and <unk> and <unk> us to <unk>
So let's talk about this.
How do we lie in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in most <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, the positive things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
And in my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
Now, lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more commitment, more commitment, the most <unk> of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being as rational, as committed to the intellectual,
It's not just about innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also because of the convictions of the heart.
This connection to mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was to hope, guidance for spirit, a will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no <unk> disconnect with technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human -- if we don't pay attention to attention to poverty to the <unk> to inequality, to inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a young lawyer from meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to go, <unk> comes the <unk> lady, we're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and take it out.
And I said, "Be lady. Be <unk>
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was a very strong <unk> thing.
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks led to me, and he said, "Now, let me tell me a good idea of justice <unk>
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started giving myself my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been politically <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences for life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to finish the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and at the end I looked at me, and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> put my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk> but very <unk>
I believe that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way we face those challenges, those problems, that <unk>
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst we've ever had.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't belong, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it doesn't be a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in people who should be answered by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's how it isn't.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> we don't really judge ourselves by our technology, for our designs, not by our <unk> or rational.
By the end of the course we get into the character of a society, not because of the way they treat powerful and powerful people, but because of the way they treat the poor, they will give them the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond me in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> <unk> and 14 years old, that have been <unk> to be told as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what's not it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late I was wake up -- <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something that you are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for something about that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a little, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> so that my <unk> <unk> is treated like a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been <unk> conduct in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent it to the court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car, and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down from the car.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He <unk> "It's you. I said yes.
So I approached it and I <unk>
And I'm going to tell you in the ear, you know, in the ear,
He said, "I'm proud to <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That connected deeply with my interior, with my identity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
In the judge he saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> I said. And we started traveling.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came up with the cops the prosecutors <unk> <unk> the <unk>
And suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- they all participate because we were talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, I had to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and let it hear all that <unk>
I kept walking over here and there.
And finally, this old black man with a concern, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
A few minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant showed up, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black age.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black stood on my feet, looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> to this young audiences to tell this young man who keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and entertainment and creativity has to lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the eye on the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see a famous desire from the audience, from this community, to help in your senses, of doing something.
Something that isn't a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to give us the funds that are spent today in politics of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases was not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This guy is going to propose that they were going to come up with these funds to make the law of the law, to security.
I think there's a very familiar opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones that you believe.
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this is dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply chain for stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Wow. So you've been excited about this today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you so much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter <unk> These are just some clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting so much more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop of all those data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could cause us.
And so from a <unk> of stories that we can look at negative stories.
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because the digital devices provide us with negative news -- seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not surprising to be <unk>
It doesn't surprise that people think that the world goes wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe, instead, what really happens is that we got <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress conducted in the last century by a series of forces is embedded in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues for climate change, the species extinction of water and <unk> water and <unk> <unk>
As human beings are very good at solving the problems and, in the long time, we just ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average life is more than <unk> the average income per capita income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food food, the transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles Kenny who global literacy has spent 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget.
And we continue to find more and higher lives.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, much of the people living under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators -- cell phone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such <unk>
We have a lot of this technology -- and we had exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> information technology jumps in this curve, Moore's Law and double the price of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to take two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad days, in the war and peace, in the recession in the <unk> of depression and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers being used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before none of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is getting faster and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
The computer in the cloud, which my friends are built infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" from <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> to humans."
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
<unk> with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the cell phone.
Four years ago, at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can impact the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students might impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to make life <unk> for every single <unk> it's about creating a life of the way.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> Three in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
So the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal one.
It's tied up with oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came out and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the shortage of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about tortured but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy went 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager of the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture, how do you get <unk>
"A pale dot <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, and the two percent ice is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> -- already <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator here.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source and saltwater, water water, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just believed that I'm going to make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation, because this technology is happening today.
And we've seen it on cell phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan is 25 years ago.
And, of course, with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton did 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars a video -- <unk> images of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose value of market with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes to it when it comes to health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device where they speak, and because they have <unk> they can be able to get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the payload charge is 25 percent and there are <unk> health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that won't be able to call the health <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, to go from two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion minds were never before <unk> that you add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you say? What do you want?
And instead of an economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud they'll become more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed.
What did these three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't afford it.
And one thing I learned with the X is that smart teams guided by their passion with a clear goal, they can do things that are <unk> things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the <unk>
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this college professors -- among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came up with each other, and they started <unk>
And it has been shown that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better -- protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds of new minds that we would have to work on to work in the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades in front of decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they thought they were <unk> but it didn't.
You actually pick fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned so much with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The Lagos was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, some <unk>
There were about 20 feet short, the black beard <unk>
And fishing from this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made up of the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches at <unk>
They put a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
Now, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- well, it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad is called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in him, and we did studies in the south of the Southern China, and above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
I know now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> small blobs about <unk> remains that are fish of coral reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start commercial fisheries.
The background is going to be a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
They didn't have the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to get them out, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time that they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
But we don't believe it.
They put the start on the start -- the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images to use the images of their conscious life as normal as normal and <unk> forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they didn't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the emergence of changes.
And at the end of the end of the end of the time we had a <unk> remains.
And that, in great extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies kill animals without knowing what they've done until a few generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very abundant before they <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals everywhere.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a big sea with big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time you get a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientific, <unk> that was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence introduced in a previous way is not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like Captain such and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can't be used for, or usually they don't use the scientists of the fish, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies.
Hence the huge role that can be a protected marine zone.
Because with marine protected areas we really recreated the past.
And we have the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a marine protected protected area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think the arts and cinema can fill in a vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay simulation.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched by the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do we <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only thing to give, is to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube video.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are doing <unk> and what is the importance of that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
But today video video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be used on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, just a small percentage gets viral gets a myriad of views and making it a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this clip out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, I saw 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of popularity of the summer.
He was not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk> <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos from nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that we played the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> presents us with new and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, I have to start on Friday.  You all want it to come in the end of the week, the weekend.   So on Friday. You get a Friday.  KA: Don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> Chris is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
So just like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it's Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. National Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view, and they share with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an automatic piece of animation.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that that's rare, you know there is a <unk> version that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that awakened between the Internet <unk> community.
There were <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old one.
And then it became an international day.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this sort of a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not only <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or RS: Black or <unk> <unk>
What to script might have been written by this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video per minute, just the unique and unexpected thing can be able to make it so that these things have done it.
When a friend told me I had to see this great video of a kind that <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by not circular by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you right through the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect and your humor, Casey <unk> made that five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth for everything again that we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of predicting creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new type of media, and that we all have access and is the audience which defines popularity as well."
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media -- but we give the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life was supported in the single hope of unity and freedom in his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> faced the fact that their life had been totally been in vain.
The words for so long, friends, now we will.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> slowed down into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined for a task that <unk> her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a four year-old <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat attached to the icy <unk> Sea.
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was <unk> rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we asked us, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, the <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came in several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to reset for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who died and died, end the journey was too much for it; and the first apple that I tried to, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had got the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women throughout three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> whose population is comprised of <unk>
Unlike the middle of the middle class in the middle of the middle class of the existence I had <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> was exchanged among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farmers. And then in a car assembly line, working six days, twice a turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title on I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and that an extra mentoring of English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> who was usually <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of middle for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> go home."
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were excited about our day and we were hearing the movements of our grandmother's movements.
My mother suffered <unk> every ship.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares were going to be able to get it out.
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come up with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry transition and <unk> boys and <unk> kids caught between two worlds.
They were set subsidies and <unk>
They were created.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student who was going to be <unk>
On the other hand, I was getting involved in <unk> lives and abuse, drug abuse, abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I was elected the young Australian year.
And I went through a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of not <unk>
As <unk> <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard <unk> and houses she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years -- <unk> on the day of each one and running <unk> on the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got into the ship.
He had ever been an option.
He said to me, <unk> not to be the <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking, more was <unk> to speak.
I met people out of all the paths in life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of what possible.
And even though I ended my graduate work, I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new in the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be, but not the way we fear the world.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, a optimism called a <unk> <unk> of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
I would take a small group of people who are the slogan that the motto cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a dime.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup that everybody <unk>
It will be good at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up step.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who matters.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it had a <unk> to <unk> and take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel in <unk> when she died, to <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk is a monk and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
He asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"I have no <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Since we were and how life came to us, we can now see that men who would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that for it?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, <unk> brave at each <unk> the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give them a safe, you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about the age of the old Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a cart and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when they <unk> the great prince British warrior Indian, I had <unk> taking a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he was able to get water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And so I was very excited about it.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technological <unk> was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it to <unk>
We give our inspiration.
And so I told me, <unk> me in this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than kill her.
I went through books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we where we are.
And I put up the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do for us?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I become a character from the book.
In a number of moments I get a <unk> the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner girl is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic magic, to those ideas that we were working on children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And actually, they light up your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that comes growing, and it will drive you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect to me is to create Indian content, and in contemporary societies.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been thrown attached to their <unk> have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to get back to this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and, in a chapter, you have a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
In this way you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside of the connection between magic, the Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and video on and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear about the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology will come to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> <unk>
"How can we care?
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects we fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I got <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get 95 percent <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor in <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is -- not at the same time that he needs <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but he can see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my scale Wi-Fi and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need an <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure that are used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
And from the next week we're going to be available after the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would stop in their homes, to take their little blood pressure, they will take their own blood pressure, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, turn back to control and to be <unk> from their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing firing firing of attention and <unk> of demand and other issues.
You know, techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients on the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with you with a video with you.
We all have checks and navigation training.
Maybe even we have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM ATMs in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one would ever do.
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this point.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> please make it <unk> where, and when it's open, sometimes you open up in a new office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and to the weeks to use your cell phone to find the nearest <unk> to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we wish to make it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that they will help us find work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
They could be services, or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in its place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
It was mixed with my first passion for the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process I was in planning
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this is a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist to unexpected.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or photos like <unk> dark and colorful photos and the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say a journalist, I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want to have been captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capture an idea that with capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look real.
It's the details or the <unk>
Did you touch light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how can you perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But they combined in a way they can create something that still looks like <unk> as it existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, let's go into the brain because the brain is not accepting the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic and I think they're those in which we don't even touch the things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine pictures it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images they play with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and end of different images with a perfect joint.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
So you might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that is easier to create a place that you find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to come up and find the different locations for the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, even I made the red house at the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome, I think it takes for planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job to take the pictures of the photos, the result can be very beautiful, and it can be very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one that took out of a decision?
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other that we usually see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the <unk>
I'm going to talk about technology with continuous curves. It's something new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are we going to do technological curves on scales.
The answer is that if you draw the draw on a normal curve that, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to show you the diagram would look ridiculous.
Would it be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve.
But if something like this, it takes a lot of change.
If today's transportation technology is as quickly as the last <unk> tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go into that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented story in the history of technological growth, which every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look -- if you're going to make these curves.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
So let's take one of two things.
Or it will be turned into a typical curve that I know like this until it comes up with something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something will happen.
And we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: What is that new way that <unk>
What new state is going the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because something is going on.
We can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different than extrapolate that we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer I.T.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at the long-term things.
The scale of time in which I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at every billion years.
So we go back about two and a half thousand years old when the Earth was a very big rock rock with a lot of chemicals that spread around them.
If you look at the way that those chemicals are organized we give us an idea of how things were.
And I think there's theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that moment, it was floating on a <unk> of oil with all sorts of chemical prescriptions inside the inside.
Some of those oil droplet was a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate out materials from the outside and so <unk>
And they started to split.
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> oil.
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> you have a distributed distribution of the chemicals that you <unk>
So every single droplet was a little bit different.
In fact, drops that in some way, being better at the time to incorporate up the chemical <unk> <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemistry, very simple chemistry, but things get interesting when these blobs learned the trick of the <unk>
In some ways that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that <unk> system.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the American security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have many of them in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have taken it down in the room.
What was the next here?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy about another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things were <unk> very different and was that these cells started trading and communicate information forming such a cell form.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are lots of resilient to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and established a <unk>
And that <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community to become more and were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities, communities of many different cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have lots of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not serves without the heart, or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make information in the community.
These are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that these mobile mobile communities.
In fact, they started <unk> inside the community being responsible for <unk> to understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not at the time period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn how to eat some fruits because I knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit set.
So the fact that the nervous system to build those information structures into a huge evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to be confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a kind of vague idea and <unk> in their heads that kept some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we made it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in the other brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now go through periods similar periods of <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods -- the information processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape video tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to manage that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the history that I told you about took one billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
Bacteria -- language and so on, took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life design and I make computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the human <unk>
But now it design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that it makes every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that makes it something that would not could, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method I've been using yesterday is evolution itself.
So we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequence of instructions to chance?
You could run these instructions at random, just run all of those programs, and take those of those programs, and take those of those that are <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say numbers, I just want to pick up numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to tidying numbers.
And of course, it's unlikely that some random random sequences of instructions, we got numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
They put those and <unk> the rest.
And now <unk> the best ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk> to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> kids, that <unk> <unk> and that children are going to have the properties of both of these programs.
So we got a new generation of music programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Go back again.
I got some mutations <unk>
And it tries again and bring it to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that give you absolutely perfect numbers.
In fact, they're a much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to <unk> to see how they work.
They're brown programs.
But they hit the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of getting the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was going into a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a flight flight -- don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than which produces normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much faster quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at a analog time when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that should change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give up a part of my false <unk>
Before I treat my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the field of play without being <unk> and that anybody who is going to launch it to the first base, not come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> hit you.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League League of <unk> in running over 400 strokes at a regular season.
Now let's get this to my medicine world where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place remote and a dear self has two coronary coronary arteries and his family doctor comes to a cardiologist whose record record is <unk>
But do you know anything?
She's actually getting remarkably better this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'm going to ask you.
What do you think you should be the average hits of a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is <unk> the world, and I was included, with the trick of being perfect.
I never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was saying when I was in medical school.
I was an African-American student.
Once a fellow in high school, he said that Brian Goldman studied until a blood test.
which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> apartment in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the human diagnosis and the usual <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were to take everything, then you would know everything, or as you can think of it as close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the emergency room to the emergency service where I worked on.
I was given to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room comes to a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist going to that patient to me.
And it will report the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I heard it, I heard a sound <unk> on both sides, what I showed you a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, and they get to our lungs, they fill with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment of the <unk>
I gave aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure on their heart.
I gave him a <unk> of water, so that he could eliminate liquid <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get the phone and did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to give up information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident who will pay constant care.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss without my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
By the send to her house, no attention to a voice in my inner which would say, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the tall, and the ambulance with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I would stop to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. At that time I did something I don't normally do normally, actually.
It went through the emergency service to home.
And there was another nurse, not that he <unk> the lady <unk> before, but he told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency medical doctors <unk>
Other specialists fear it too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients.
The three words are: you remember that?
He remembers the patient's <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of having come to his house, after I would give her the high school, she suffered and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought it to the emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure, which means a shock of severe severe.
I barely breathe and was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
They put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and waiting against all hope that he was going to be.
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never did.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, they got to what was going on.
And the ninth day, they let her go. The lady was <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks later, I was excited about it and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat down by yourself, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't stand with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is <unk> which I talk about is that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was it wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure we would have the things and made sure that I didn't tell me.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Shortly at that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in one day, he opened up the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I felt better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if we had the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes to give away those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an activist, in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him out of penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> my chief chief asked to talk to me in his office.
And I made the three words, you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can put it into Google -- it's an infection, not the throat, but from the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He said, fortunately, you don't know.
You get antibiotics on it, and you get rid of a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were trained to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
So we had an X-ray of them, but it turned out normal. A colleague that was checking the patient perceived to some sensitivity in the lower quadrant, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to get it.
I looked at him and notice a certain sensitivity in the lower quadrant, called the surgeon.
Both were operated on, and they recovered well.
But every single case I was obsessed with me.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get to you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go in a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party, you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me that I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of the mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who fail to sleep and the ones that they can't sleep, and the ones who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if we take care of medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a bad personal study of bad medical litigation and errors in order to learn how much possible, from the first paper I wrote for the Toronto "Star to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, in which one out of 10 drugs will be wrong, or the <unk> is not right in a system where the infections is increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, <unk> <unk> by medical errors are killed by doctors.
The U.S. Institute of Medicine set up 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are.
A self-organizing system where knowledge is going to be added every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and, all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like us, and we eliminate all the professionals who are likely to error, well, not to be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students <unk> <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, I didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human -- you know human, they will accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it is trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It makes the mistakes of other people not trying to kill them, but in a loving and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, they will make errors <unk>
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I memory.
Do you know how many decisions we take on a <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick up an average American, are about 70 to a day.
Not long ago in a research followed for a bunch of presidents of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of the <unk> for these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every single work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or over time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of the <unk> category <unk> and how many of a <unk>
How do we figure out how to deal with those <unk>
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for you to give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this supermarket, very, very <unk> at least in that time it was very sophisticated.
He was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park here.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water <unk> and this was when we made water <unk>
I loved going to that store, but I just asked myself, why never buy anything?
This is a shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager of the manager and asked him to do well this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out to me full of tourists who came up every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
They put a post for <unk> right to the gate of the store.
We put out there from six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, where the people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when he had been killed, a 60 than when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a coffee <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
From those that stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were in 24.
Well, let's decide that we don't buy <unk> we're probably good at <unk> <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the decision-making overload is affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even when we don't care about it.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, in between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program -- people to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger that the number of funds had had fewer participation.
So if we look at the extreme ends, we see that in the plans that give two funding, the rate of participation was 70 percent, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that I offered about 60 funding, the rate of participation went to <unk> <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choices, more people are being used by avoiding actions or hedge funds.
As soon as you had more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts for the market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are going to engage to optimize the human financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
What's more likely to be that we are going to make the decision -- even when it goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
They are more likely to choose things less <unk> even though they objectively get better.
The main reason is that we have to do with looking at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so we can compare to contrast and choose from that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have, in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, cut, get rid of odd <unk> there will be an increased sales increase, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> I eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> they became increased by two <unk> bigger sales and less costs.
And you know that texting is about 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, you have about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce set.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the <unk> David <unk> <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safety of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
These are all options <unk>
The first thing I do is ask <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before this session, before this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a couple of vacation to all paid the world's most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to get it up, and then I want you to give you a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply supply.
<unk> Okay. Anyone who's ready to accept it.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really hit my own hands.
All right.
You actually had more information on the first trial, which in the second trial, but I can tell you what they thought the second time was more real.
Because images make it look more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of the business <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very carefully <unk>
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average when you use debit cards when you use credit card or credit cards that when you use a lot.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get out more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that we were looking at exactly how we <unk> we had a little <unk>
What we added was that we appeal to the staff that you would think of the positive things that you would think about in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can run more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazines.
We saw that it was <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> framework is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something that they <unk> not when they <unk>
And you often see this problem with these huge lists of fundraising.
I am expected to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision buy a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows us to <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions.
<unk> color in the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
So what I'm going to do is vary the order that decisions come from.
So half of the clients are going to go from lots of choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go for a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to say?
How involved you are.
If you look at the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We find that the ones that are going from many choices at times, we would have the default button over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of the information.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick box of change is not saying nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building now has more equipped with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives -- to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in your own business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of an election is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1960s. In the East East Germany, if you had a typewriter to write it up to the government.
I had to register a piece of text example written with the machine.
And that for the government to track the origin of the <unk>
If they found a writing with the wrong message they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think of that somebody could do this, how much that we can make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and printing one page, that page will end up having some yellow colored dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's what's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot about this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, huge amounts of them.
There are really many cases of <unk> online <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, you know, <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their fortunes make their fortunes online but they do it by the means by illegal media through banking <unk> when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get some information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> van <unk> You don't know his <unk>
And I say today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad in worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of suicide in importance today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them to motivate them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a massive role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals that make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national United States that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authoritative authority of the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
It was <unk> the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week I asked a meeting with Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death from people to call it to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do the <unk>
Well, you need to do if you have a website with <unk> services -- services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority.
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters <unk> the Israeli secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder had notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had this tool for 280 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide them tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
You get the connection to the Internet.
I even think of tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and to listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play the privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that you will ever have today, will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions you need to worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south part of National Park.
These are cows from my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cattle in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle <unk>
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we got up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
People were dying who protect our community and the livestock and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, six to nine years old, is responsible for her father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions would be afraid.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because it was even helping lions to see the pen from far.
I don't know <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, and they came out, and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found out that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn out and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
You get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load up the battery and the <unk> battery electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how they see it when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never had problems with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood have heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals who were killed and asked me if I could put the lights in.
I said yes.
You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also being used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators, like immersion. <unk> and also is being used to rape elephants from farms.
Thanks to this <unk> I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have it, and I teach them how to fix it.
So one year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> my father, and he used to see flying planes and he used to see me that someday I would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when <unk>
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with the lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting you can hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other people's <unk>
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a bit about CA: CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know that they were already invented electrical fences -- but I want to make my own.
CA: You know, just once, right now, and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of <unk> Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to take it in every single step that I would spend my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small one, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was asking myself about the rest of the world, I thought that would happen all of my life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister from my sister.
That said, "When you go to this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
As long as I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms watching his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
It was a huge famine <unk> in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and microwave cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> the energy <unk> all around me was completely <unk> at night except for the sea lights in China, almost crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light, and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, enabling North Koreans, crossing <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, floating on.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee African.
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North African refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested when I was arrested for the Chinese police in the police station.
Someone had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going down.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the time, an officer told him to another, "This was a fake report -- she's not <unk>
And he left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seeking asylum.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese policeman and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were <unk> were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans did not get so lucky.
Every year, countless North North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans haven't been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all the world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to give you to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of divide.
It even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call out of a pride of me.
Although I went to life in South Korea, it was not easy, I had a plan. I started studying for the university.
Just when I was starting to meet my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location removed from the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I went to the border to North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to put it in a way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
On <unk> I took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated around the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did all about releasing my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the South South Korea.
I was going to go and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man said, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and another two North Koreans and to take them out of prison.
I went through all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I am helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of stranger <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to get to the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the benefits of hope that the people who are needed to do.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea,
But achieve its freedom is only half the struggle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in contact with the family still with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans, an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North North beings around the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Asia.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast food, <unk>
So the city planners came together and thought, let's change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to South Los Angeles as if it changed what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  <unk> <unk> fast food, <unk> terrain.
So just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center home to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to bring more people to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I'm going to tell you that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
In addition to me I got tired of driving 45 minutes back and go back to buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land that we call a <unk>
It's 45 meters by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it right.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes up to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it right.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest and trees -- you know, nine <unk>
What we do, we are a kind of group paid by the way through gardeners of all the <unk> across the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got <unk>
The city I stood up on top and in <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made it <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
One order made a judicial order to plant food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more invasive terrain.
It has 68 miles of dry terrain.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That is enough space for planting <unk> million plants.
Why on Earth does it not look like this?
We put a plant to a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of them.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Center.
I grew up there, and I got my kids there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up with my art.
Like an artist <unk> that <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, it's my <unk> from that canvas.
You will be able to see what the Earth can do, if you stop your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education system of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
They will be able to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and his daughter, were like <unk> at night and they were in my backyard, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> I don't respond to people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "For God no, I am not afraid that you're going to be <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I shared their stories about how this had affected her and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of 50 people who come from, and they work and <unk> every volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, the kids are eating <unk>
If they grow tomatoes, they will eat <unk>  But if none of this are <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I look at young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they are stuck with you in this path that are on this path that is designed for them, that doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who were moving from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into cafes healthy.
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
And the funny thing about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work with people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you get the <unk> take your <unk> right?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably agree to agree with me that this is a very <unk> road.
It's made out of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
They can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we are going to have.
And especially if you go on your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads on asphalt roads.
The asphalt is an material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, it has pores and water can go through it, so all the water water flow down the sides and will have a road that is easy to drive, and they don't make water water anymore.
Noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very hot. All of the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you see that on this highway the stones on the surface side.
So first a stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and you know, you know, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light -- the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So, if you drive on the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel and that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the wool of steel on very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of wool from steel on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially the steel, very good at that.
So what you have to do is you heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks flow by the surface.
Today I used an <unk> of <unk> because I can't bring the big <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested lots of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to do a test for trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did age the samples, we put a lot of payload in them, both of the payload for our <unk> machine and <unk> and we came back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using hydrogen fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they can double the surface of the surface -- they actually save a lot of money from very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about this as well.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool it first before I can show you how your repair behaves like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember drawing myself a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC on his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally about it.
<unk> <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> <unk>
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were pulled out of Afghanistan and made illegal girls go to school.
For the next five years, I was shocked, as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be out there, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route to that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books on market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us sitting in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we were <unk> our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a while, the school suddenly came up for a week, because the Taliban would be <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan, <unk> where his daughter, my mother, was to school and so his father would be <unk>
But my mentor mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite <unk>
For him, there was a bigger risk to not educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were times that I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your home for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do.
So, you don't want to do it.
Today, I have 22 years.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than <unk> and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school at <unk> College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one that was <unk> from his home to the bravery of educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He doesn't only go from my college degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador for <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> by them, even though and even in front of a surgical opposition in the front.
As a <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter would go from <unk> to his village, and he literally stood out of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, you're the phone, a voice had a <unk> that if I kept sending her daughter to school, I would come back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not to hurt the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I realized from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are the first compelling <unk> the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes didn't last much, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and his parents who would come to them, that <unk> I see a future <unk> and a <unk> change.
In order to me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls of <unk> will tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
They've been nearly two years since the revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the Tunisian revolution like the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens were going into and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a big revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage to the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 dead 50,000 people were able to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy burden of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved -- along with many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a critical transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and crime.
About 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I began to organize workshops on the development of capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- the <unk> of women, and a movement of women, leaders -- to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and by our right to participation participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> that it was more and more <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was successful and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, little -- the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, was <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> old mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the U.S. ambassador and the attack of <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the official of military officers in the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their violation of human rights violations.
Our society formed a <unk> mindset more, and it's away from the ideals and the early principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all to talk to us with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we make worse, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought the peace and stability and security to Libya.
<unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation.
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of more consensus than it needed the choices, that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the most of the most of the most likely to need to be <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and call it for days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion agents and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but also put it in practice <unk> rather than <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship of female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that is known for all of the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> which involves all the humanity that men and women, which all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus, the uterus is completely covering the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is the whole existence.
This is what he was like, "My <unk> is <unk>
This is what he was like, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That we are all given to you about mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a question about why it's an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everyone does. Why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who would tell him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, as I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the wealth of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> or long duration or, in the families, the last place where we want to or we expect to find <unk> because the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who <unk> it and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had had a <unk> university from the <unk> <unk> and she worked in a very big bank from Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
And I had a lot of big <unk> like apples and a <unk> and it seemed to be so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything from me, that I was ready, that I had gone to Harvard, who would put a passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my work work from my dreams, but I thought I'd be doing sacrifices for your partner, so I went back, I left my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> which was entering a head of physical, financial and psychological psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where you were supposed to have to feel so sure I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one he kept under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that they needed those guns because of the trauma that lived in a small basis.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message to me, and, although I had never lifted my hand, my life was really serious at danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical physicist in <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
I was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mom's girlfriend of my mother and married him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure we lived happily living forever, because I loved it, and he wanted a lot to me.
And I was very, very <unk>
I just had a lot of sense for the wedding and a family to form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never have any harm.
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in my head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our skin of honey -- went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> went on one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was excited when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three women are a victim of domestic violence or bullying. At some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody is doing is: Why don't you just do it?
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone anywhere.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people make people, because we are victims, we know something that you would usually have, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim will finally put the relationship, after the victim because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
And they include permanent deserts, even after the <unk> has returned to a financial resources, and even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time not to be <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if I'd allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, and full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as the victims as <unk> women -- women will provide <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say "The guilt is it for <unk> as if the victims are intentionally <unk> from men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also have learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and they will save their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor.
I got married with a <unk> and <unk> man.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to having ever more, would ever be a <unk> pistol with my head on someone who says I want.
At this point, they are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, that I'm listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter to her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end up with my <unk> particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and that's my last petition to you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
abuse are only silence.
They have the power of ending domestic violence, simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
We have the abuse of the abuse of the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues at work, their friends and family.
They were looking at their view of the survivors as fantastic and <unk> people who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the current signs of violence to intervene to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families and our families in the Siwa secure and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
It will be <unk> for 10 years now.
And I feel that at this moment there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed in the room -- luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are going to be killed, when they <unk> they don't have to go to them, now, but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what I think about in such a 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use it.
The worst part is to spend this sweater through the head, because it's when they're going to laugh about me, so you don't do anything while you cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what you thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would tell me that I was going to go back and make the hair of the guy.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for the work, there is very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my work sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always doing it, but they <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be a role model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape -- to the <unk> and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage values that I've known to leverage for money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing both models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all of the models of the University of New York and the <unk> models, just <unk> which is less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can you be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know.
But then what I would tell you every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, I was still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> or the American <unk> or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you go down your studies, and you have a show and a few jobs on your back, no matter what <unk> is, if you pretend that you want to be president of the United States, but you have your husband's <unk> Model of your inner underwear for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures were <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was shocked, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have even my period.
I know that we're entering the personal field, but it was a child.
And so he looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> and we never use, except the previous couple of time, but the privilege I get, are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to get money, and they gave me the free dress of free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> put a light in red and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to be able to continue to <unk>
I think of these privileges by my way, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of what they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the teenagers who were stood with and 86 percent were black and Latino people, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
How many times are I <unk>
When I did research for this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little thinner and you have the brightest hair and you feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we will.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with smart and exciting people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I have never said in front of them, is: I'm a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask, with some slight legs and the brightest hair will be more happy?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most likely legs -- the brightest hair and their laundry -- but probably they are physically physically <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If you have something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable with recognizing the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was more enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures, and I didn't have the <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very carefully carefully in the lighting.
In fact, most trees were random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give me a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo holding my daughter on his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
I happened that we went back to New York -- just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> trip and you continue the <unk>
This is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a whole stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been stuck with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change the life.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that day that day a girl in five years could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a October week and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not just at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope for the whole year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, when suddenly he was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the rope shop that <unk> small in previous <unk>
And it described to me what I was at five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of the actively participating in the memory of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't want to go close to someone and asked him, and you take a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney involuntary laughter, such as dumb characters, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the printing press, laughter and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the limbs.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mainly in the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species from these 16, 11 very high risk of extinction.
So, why are we going to hear them are important -- first of all, provide vital ecological services -- <unk>
It's our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers down to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria -- they help to absorb anthrax than being by them would stretch and cause great loss of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historic <unk>
They've been associated with the old culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between 1900 and below Egypt.
In <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and <unk> his life to save the <unk> goddess of 10 heads <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky, in places like Tibet -- no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the endangered endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey on the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned to use them in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs on <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge bomb over time to <unk> the number of cases of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the <unk> Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market of <unk>
So what are you doing? OK, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel for different countries, so to focus on a corporate problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become active -- you can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will inform you about <unk> but talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, without energy energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> a young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, everything else is going to be <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people to grow food.
So we got with seeds <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach local tomatoes to grow Italians and <unk> and and and and ...
Of course, people were not going to be interested in doing that, so they would help them to come to work -- and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were amazed that the local ones, in such a fertile valley, had no agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't look at anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, all in Africa was growing <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> to grow this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, why don't we have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought we only do Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the Americans, they were doing the French, which was the French, and then to see what the ones were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  So let's see the waste that we give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western organizations, we've delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and treat people just two things: or <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if I were my kids, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said by especially economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the floor and said, "You can all -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to be 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Do you?
You never get to a community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not no, for a time, but not in a <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have to do.
So, planning has this point.
To the smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't have their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face -- you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the medical doctor of the business, which is established with you in their house, in the coffee table, and that helps her to find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> Western Australia, City.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this <unk> junk we get to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And so --  So --  So --  So the government says, "Nice again."  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death of the <unk>
So now <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk with you.
You have to offer you a privacy, privacy, it has to be fantastic to <unk> and then you will come up in the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a <unk> community, intelligence and passion?
What have you ever got to do is the morning?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you, is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils will not renewable fossils -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- communicate to seven billion people -- in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There is a beautiful story that in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York was not there within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic manufacturers <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few times, <unk> factories in places that are <unk>
<unk> Michigan.
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you a <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk> service.
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company has to be able to do three things to <unk> the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at it and looked at the 100 iconic companies, <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all new Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what somebody would do by this gentleman who talks about this <unk> somebody who is asking you, what take?
What can you? Can you do it?
OK, you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." I think I would look <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings, and better understand our <unk>
How do you share more of our hopes for empty stores for our communities to be able to reflect our own needs and dream.
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It is always supporting the music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most urban <unk>
I live close to this house and I thought how could it turn it into a stronger space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Their death was sudden and unexpected and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And this made me a profound gratitude for the history of life.
It gave it clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But <unk> for keeping this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget what's really important to you.
So with the help of old and new friends made the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and painted over her phrases for <unk> he died of death <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die I want to be tested by <unk>  Before she died, I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
Before they die I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before I die. I want to plant a <unk>
"Before I die. I want to live outside the <unk>
Before they died, I want to give it once more."
"Before I die I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about to accommodate the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and we change it.
This happened last year and started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in civic civic colleagues, we had a kit. And now they've been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if they give us ourselves an opportunity to express each other.
Two of the valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions in increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to conserve perspective and remembering that life is very short and so on.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will become more power.
You think about death -- our life will be our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and more media to share and more means to share dreams and the people that surrounds us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a unique request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
I'm not talking about, but it transmits joy that some of the best <unk>
<unk> knows what love.
They share it <unk> what happened to happen.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter to the religious differences and look at this: It's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, I was trying to talk to words that I can't even think of it, it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. He's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, he would become pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem like <unk>
But most people disagree with.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what he pushed my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although they wouldn't consider them within the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- who were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it plays a different way, that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is to be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or cure cure in the world.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat whatever they would have <unk>
As it was growing up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity <unk> had something really <unk> an absolute nature and innocent, a child that would see the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
The normal, the beauty is giving us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be normal to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, people or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each one of us has a gift in its inner and, honestly, the search for normal, is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for greatness and progress dies at the moment we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been <unk> on the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher, which gave a communication class to engineering students.
I was scared.  It was <unk> of the <unk> of these students with their big minds, and their big books and the great <unk> words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it had must have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt like that, I felt when I had those conversations with students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great deal of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our larger challenges -- from energy to the environment and health care and if we don't know about it, the job is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please give me <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
You don't tell us that we study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as to make them silly anymore.
Instead, as Einstein said that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can really communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget about signs of <unk>
You have asked why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets are killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported too much in the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective. It shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the Eiffel Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> which is that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can then provide graphs that will connect our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what you would get.
And I think these are just some key ones that can help the other open and look at the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
It's just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that he's looking for a public charge without mind <unk> or <unk> and that, when he won, it gets the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the <unk> named <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
They sent him into the Tower of London and he was told, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end of it had such a popular support in London that I won in London had been won.
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most people think it's a literal question.
It's not. It's by a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it from the <unk> State <unk> and other <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of you just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was for quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired of the world got tired because this debate was going down for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> under this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
And the House of Representatives didn't want Washington to come from power.
They didn't want to call him King if he was giving him or his <unk> ideas.
So, they wanted to give the most <unk> the most <unk> more <unk> that it came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it only meant <unk> which was a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a serious degree as ridiculous and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't know.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite of my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we are going to be able to be able to wait for the years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this -- I want to tell you, is that the President of President of America doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of <unk> air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed the title of <unk>
So in the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, looked like -- well, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to be like humble when you tell you that you're now President <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to do is you know?
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually the truth changes a lot more the words that what these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under land in a illegal illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is warm up and dust and it is hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones stones with tools primitive.
Like others, I take a cheap flashlight of light -- he holds the head with this rubber <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met before the control and dropped out of control in that <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep way that hole in that hole will risk their lives without pay, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and went home, but they may never will, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only honor of being the only <unk> in the G8 Summit the <unk>
Among all of the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO that has been dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not to just <unk>
When we finished talking to me I was very sad I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me like my stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So it started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of them even thought about the second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are currently over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced all over it comes to slave slaves to it.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of the <unk> about <unk>
And yet, today you can make entire families all over generations for U.S. <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates over <unk> billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better education to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and they can't escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves they have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange <unk> show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> temperature of 54 degrees -- men, kids, in fact, entire families <unk> into a heavy canopy outside of <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads -- to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> to the trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day.
I had no coffee to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> was made to just be pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot and <unk> and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to get it, and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> which was on my side of my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just to me, but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not civil <unk>
I could put them in an worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he trusted that he was <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> rocks for <unk> <unk> until they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who were loaded and the children put them down to their heads with straps and made of clubs, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with what <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> burnt their houses.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness I would tell you that it would be hard for me to work in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously sex.
They led me by some <unk> <unk> that would give this dirty basement <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local for <unk> prostitution for prostitution of <unk>
They have small rooms and private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every position is dark and dirty identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse for their clients.
From foot in <unk> I remember a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> on the stairs where they were born.
There were no <unk>
There was no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because you touch a very difficult topic, it's important to point out that the slavery even -- even sexual traffic will happen around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold to be sold every year as a sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associated with the labor of <unk>
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families <unk> in the silk trade.
This is a family family.
Your hands black hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of your children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me their stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake <unk> the world's largest <unk>
When we come, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family family on a boat, two older brothers -- some younger kids, there are sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families who had been separated from their families, and they were forced to work <unk> by the boats on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up there was a piece that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> and often trap networks and kids -- <unk> and fear is thrown to the water to release the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of her I love it isn't going to flee and like all of life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries the younger slaves under his seat.
I met these guys five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the last one.
On the cold, cold night and <unk>
And it can point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes what possible.
Who would get to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
He asked us to take it on a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked him the driver to come out very quickly.
And then pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the path, this is the path.
As we started to <unk> we took the <unk> that we would take the way and after walking around an hour and found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of my photos on my head as they go through the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in hot waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
And these miners in a pit of a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet and these people carry out stone heavy stone bags that will then be transported to another area where they put the stone in order to extract the gold.
And the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to it, the margin is going to be working at some other fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died his uncle, you know, <unk> the debt of the uncle in the mines.
When I met him, I had been working on the mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that doctors said that it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet to that, it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and is this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give you testimony about them and we're going to do everything we can to help change their lives.
<unk> I think if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not about magazines. They're about people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day to happen that I don't think of these beautiful people beautiful -- I've had the great honor to know.
And I hope that these images show a force where you see them -- and I hope that force will turn a fire and that fire <unk> on slavery is because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematics applied and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like management controllers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see more ahead.
But the <unk> for a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably a certain initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time was a virtuous dancer <unk>
In the last few years, it's made a lot of progress in treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to have tools that we need to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know whether a cure is when we have an objective and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement and other disorders of the movement there are no human <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have a neurological exam test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means out of clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam they themselves.
He would not need any personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to say to you as a conventional way to try -- you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sound to speak. We can imagine as a dancers of a <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds, and we all have a need for it. The <unk> for example.
And as <unk> requires an extraordinary training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of the vocal cords as they <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk> strings of vibrating ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something takes a lot of a cost so <unk> it appears on a mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to address.
We can reduce their patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for the research clinic.
With high monitoring, we could get goals.
We could do a mass mass of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So when we give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Global <unk> Initiative.
<unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without disease, you can call under the price and leave the recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the form of TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people can not do it. You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data coming in in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion factors in pursuit of real markers of disease.
TR: They have an precision <unk> at this point?
It's much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works in the mobile phone network too, as well, what the project is. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are gray.
We lie in the dark, with no windows and so large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin skin models -- the perfect skin -- we do the impossible <unk> we do the impossible -- we can have the press all the time but some of us are really artists with a talent with many years of experience and a true love for images and photography.
On March 11th of 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that were happening in Japan.
And a long time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> where I was <unk> there was the place working as part of the response team.
I joined with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> <unk> people in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water has gotten over 24 feet tall and over three miles, land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
You take debris from the channels and the <unk>
They were <unk> and we took the slime house to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both of the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places in the villages around them to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As we walked from the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean up the toilets, huge <unk> huge <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place in the village where the <unk> center is taking the photos.
And I had the honor of them and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspirational I had heard about the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I could go back my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, they were still in the top of the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with much accuracy and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would never look like her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they got some more <unk> and they took more <unk> so it was back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
After two weeks, I had 150 people out of <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of the libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time you get to <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could get an hour of an hour. I could make a few weeks.
It could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures long as in seawater, covered with bacteria, with algae, and even with the time of the time I spend a lot of time with the time of time I continue to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture at least it was clean dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky in relation to the photos.
I had started to <unk> her same, but he stopped to realize that they would get them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face would not have been able to be able to afford the images in a single picture, and they would take the whole picture.
When I picked up his photographs with some of his history with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble of the rubble -- pretty far away from where he used to be their house, but his colleagues were <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her young children, not so small now, but their two children were at school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took him a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures her son was 14.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do to look, something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past day that had not been done by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there to <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up more of <unk> and the great <unk> -- the vast majority -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families hundreds of <unk> pictures and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend over <unk> more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take for us, but the first thing that we would try to look for.
This is what the project is, to restore a small bits of humanity, to give someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this is delivered to somebody, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger and give something, using their talent for something that are not very thin skin <unk>
I would like to read this email. I sent him Cindy on the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in pictures.
One in particular, a picture of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, <unk> around a baby, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me around a little bit of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mom, and my newborn daughter hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the very few our basic needs, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> inspired us to inspired awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet going through an apple in an apple exhibition just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new type of <unk> a new technique that can be able to create video on the slow motion of light.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and we challenge the camera <unk>
If I take a laser pointer and switch on it and take it back into a <unk> <unk> or a number of <unk> to create a single package of photons just a millimeter thick, just a millimeter wide wide size.
And that package of photons, will travel to the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a regular bullet than a commons.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how are those photons spread inside this <unk>
What is the light aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light moving.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Some of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble flowing inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights from the top of the bottle, it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a normal, and current and we make it go through the same distance and we see it on slow down to about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to see that film?
One day?
It would be a very boring movie -- it's a slow bullet <unk>
And what about doing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the table, the tomato wall and the wall wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk> composition.
But if you look at once more this tomato -- you'll realize that, as the light goes out of the tomato Valley, it still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside its inside and go out after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera in the <unk>
As a photographers, you know, if you take a little bit to low exposure, it comes very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so just going into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over to creating those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw data and make it very interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become great.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the gate, and from there to the camera.
And we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera but curiously, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works this fast, our <unk> has unique capacities alone.
It has very good time and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way down to the door and also all the things that the hidden objects are, but we don't know what point that corresponds to how far away.
By projecting a laser projecting a <unk> picture, you see on the screen, it doesn't make any sense.
But let's take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the object itself.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are collisions that are going to be around the curve, and in the future.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body <unk> <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality <unk> to solve the problems in the next generation.
So as <unk> he was a scientist, he became the science in art, an art of photographs of photography.
I realized that all of the data processing that we collected every time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see that we can see that we can do.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and color code.
And look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a fun thing to do.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects A, you would have loved to see this picture.
The order in which the events happen in the world are sometimes getting on the camera.
They will give you the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and you can put it up and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are coming in, looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who are going to come up for a change, you have a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who of the presenting you have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost all of you today have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> of <unk> <unk>
This board says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider all over Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls to <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in their phone company or their Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe people stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want to have the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> Vietnam.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> that in that time it was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information that you had about me.
And I asked them once, and I went back to asked, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of it, you know a agreement.
He would send me the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> failed <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> of brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> -- 30 lines of information.
At first I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive here.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life on this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> is <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Science City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you can go back and go ahead.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to go back on the train to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me to talk about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call it to each other.
And then you call the other one another, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate to each other what time they communicate to what hour they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the way of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because now state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home tell their friends that privacy is a 21st century value and not before fashion.
When you go home, tell your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information is stored in.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor I brought to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we put it all the time.
Have a look.
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
<unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> no <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, although they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that came to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you to come.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be a disabled person.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- you're in the mall, drive in circles looking for parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same thought.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
A lot of people who have cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in the "don't target.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters would be <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents would take to the school system and get married, and if I didn't take all the way out, and if we didn't take all the way out of the ultimate note all there is my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the five years by putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that you can see it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the childhood kindergarten was walking as a fan champion who has received many <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arabic, and they are still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as <unk>
People who grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed like a lot of hunger from hunger during the <unk>
I was telling you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so we finished the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy. My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to use <unk> me too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers on a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were going to stay in <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I would drink hot cups on my back, and I got stuck in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water holding me up my eyes, and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the cure cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> which I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents got this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college.
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called a very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl who was cerebral <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk> when I finally got a <unk>
I have <unk>
By the end of it, I finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater, in the theater, crying -- historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, ask him why and she told me that because they believed it could not do the risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts stunts -- it can't be the <unk>
It was a role for the one that was literally born and had been given to an accidental actor.
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for the disabled papers.
When I was, I returned home, and my first <unk> tour, it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friends in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than <unk> and it was clear to me that managers are not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Just to make perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took my first head of New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that it was going to be high speed by the <unk> <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without <unk> and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little <unk> that is that women are not fun, and they find ourselves a lot of fun.
In 2003, my brother and father of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the World <unk> Festival in New York City now in her 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and then remind the directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program it has Keith <unk>
I walked down to a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat down in a wheelchair.
I looked at the head and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I grabbed the desk at the desk that I would not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew I didn't go back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was like <unk> <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun to learn in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that kids are <unk> but they never get rid of me or no older girl.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would see clips in line like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What is the disease there?
We should really be praying for her."
A reviewer suggested that I would even add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone on the wheelchair.
The disability are the -- Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the entertainment world.
The doctors said that they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the big state of New Jersey in <unk> 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the children refugees refugees.
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> <unk> to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, you don't have work, or <unk>
He ends up in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was giving him a guy who offers him to <unk> him after dinner for me.
He meets a <unk> group of people, that gives it a break.
He gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home, her family.
He's presented to a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a car bomb.
That little boy from that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist, and that dynamic group of people were by <unk> a terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So, how did the story of a small child trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for the future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that pulled him from what we call "the <unk> period.
And their story repeats in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young people who were <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, which are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity, of work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't afford opportunities, the history of <unk> <unk> the door of access to the violence, to violence -- will be the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital when I went to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd seen forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support a youth leaders at a business end.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat and we had rain ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me, that because it was a graduate college student, frustrated, was the perfect white man for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point to B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
It began <unk> <unk> people who typically couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point expanding to hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do about this?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative to do.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from <unk>
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could it survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for humor, creating gardens in the houses, and the businesses in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't cultivate <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, working for the government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk>
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
We put business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit -- it's really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to support them in the development and put on their business.
They encourage young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from knowledge to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
And his Park.
<unk> I hired kids on the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is that my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation and have more stories about flowers and <unk> from the Peace and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the <unk> <unk> an area <unk> north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not being on the way that we <unk> almost we could fake that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We came to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square meters, with apple hearts -- paper balls, aluminum balls, and old cells.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where to do the <unk> who cleans our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of <unk> <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two tons of waste from <unk> every day.
I wanted to meet them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and he walked along their pathways, and he interviewed people in office offices, and I learned a lot, but I was still a <unk>
I needed to buy more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I wasn't just going to travel in trucks.
And <unk> and <unk> the snow <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody wonders about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as mainstream as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong one, it will be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies continue to get the weight to the weight of their body tons of trash every day.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of FBI <unk> the waste of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering traffic all the day and pass around.
You just want to do it -- so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for worker.
And also the trash itself is filled with dangers that are often falling out of the truck.
I also learned about the trash of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the crap is as a force of nature itself.
It never stopped coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe strongly that <unk> are the most important labor of the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient way and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their dangers inherent in us in very real ways.
We needed for decades and centuries come back to <unk> and they start to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the motors in the economy begin to fail when it's endangered people.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just draw his relationship.
And then what I call our everyday speed of everyday necessary.
I mean, I mean just the speed of that we used to go used to moving at the time.
We usually don't have any <unk> or <unk> or carry our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, <unk> we forget them, because we know there's a force of work on the other side that will take away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste that maybe help reduce stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when they were.
And their work allows us to do our work.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us in except for ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always be in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a gathering of waste on the street, I grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to investigate the garbage and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times, and we did good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species should have to include and have to account all the costs, even the real human cost of the labor work.
The municipal waste is what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one who looked at somebody whose work is to take the trash of you, take a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to think about our communal life to be part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from the conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
In addition to share the fact that the different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a <unk> center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we needed to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat inside the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, he looks like nothing to do with Africa and in the third place.
It's a worth for a rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the ancient market that is this structure in the free air that thousands of people, go and buy things every day at small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building a building of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge came to the ballot on the site, which is located in a much area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And in addition to two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs in the building.
And this spreads out with an <unk> atrium, which creates a space to open air in the building that will be transferred by its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that will <unk> the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a fabric of a concrete <unk> with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons from the dresses in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas that didn't be easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what they mean.
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the shopping center because it was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economics, not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis of city.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collecting water for the <unk>
You wait for the beginning of the next year, because we go on the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master master plan for the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I have ever designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen years old with a dozen access gates by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to broaden the existing streets, creating 12 early blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the strategic points in relation to the idea of the doors to <unk> with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's take a framework that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result of almost as a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up greater density at higher levels and lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as to give up the community is occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and forth and make activities such as a race for two kilometers in the morning, or jump from a building to another building.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same pace that the buildings.
For this reason, I see more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years, a new girl came to our class. It was so remarkable, like all the new girls.
I had big amounts of hair, very brilliant hair, and a little <unk> of pencils was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good to <unk>
And I ended that year and I was filled with <unk> until I was going to <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I became a time after the exit to school, was a little late and <unk> me in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took out of my master's table <unk>
And then, I did.
It <unk> the grades of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the same.  And I set up I set up the book by <unk> But to see, some of my other teammates had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows out of <unk> and myself a row of that, just for being there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised by what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never told me.
It was all obvious <unk>
I will never be surprised.
But most of all, <unk> me, the reason why I was bothered by this <unk> so small, it was so good for <unk>
I <unk> jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which you study the <unk> in all their different ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as the ones are all <unk>
This year has been spent 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> of the ordinary -- my God, all we could possibly have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget about how <unk> it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as a cat.
I don't know how it is <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the investors that are reduced to the person, to their desire to their <unk> are a good basis for <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being a storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details you want, to nail the knife -- right?
<unk> do you all <unk> and that's something that I understood.
Everything that she makes me pleasure and give me pleasure to another one, maybe right now."
And it starts to say that the story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> detects in his lover adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a bad job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion that we have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk>
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the big amounts of hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links <unk> language with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of <unk> listening to the gates and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research in real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, a real painful truth -- in fact, what to <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us experience, causes in us a much more profound range of feelings and vital that a wise man who can afford to us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> give us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look at very <unk>
Freud would write about this later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was being consumed with the idea that his wife will <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get stuck in what his wife does.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife was doing without realizing <unk> behavior.
<unk> <unk> or really accidentally <unk> a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the <unk> are made to be <unk> but not accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> the we are, we actually became the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts or illegal.
<unk> drives us to behave in entirely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about the eight years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from what was sending terrible messages to himself, for a year.
For a year. It's a whole year.
She was trying to <unk> the new <unk> of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big even though <unk> creativity, right?
It's like novel.
Like a Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
This is the <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to do the <unk> of our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to invade your self and to <unk> what you ever have to do, and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, it takes your rings, cow accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
novels show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always used <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it is <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
They need their help, but he needs their help, but we would take it up and forth with <unk> in each of these puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once <unk> step <unk> all over your solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute, it's on the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
And all of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being he <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to take it from the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk>
So as we hope that it happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is affecting jealousy.
fiction used to the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what sweet is <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> of Apollo 11, of Apollo 11 and descended on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but their presence in the surface surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the majority of peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a 400,000 job of a 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities and government agencies.
People were killed, including <unk> crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
He walked over his surface, of which he ran after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would we care?
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The statistical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the identical words at the University of Rice <unk> in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why does it <unk>
Why do it turn our goal?
And you could also ask, why can it scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why can fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the wonder of the <unk> of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing in the moon happened in a context of a long mailing list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, they were <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew crew flew to 40,000 miles called hour.
Since 1970s, no human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the technology would be going to be going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of it.
I remember watching the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I don't get to the escape escape tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I really knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that reminds us to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have <unk> and enriched toys, things like <unk> <unk> things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale of sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years that they were born, and we would have Apple <unk> and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused us to be able to create the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worry about the risk, they preferred little investments -- they preferred little investments that could come out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which need a tremendous amount of mass capital and whose development is not in the long term. They have never invested in developing technologies because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision to be popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy sources that can compete on price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of an enhanced energy -- a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of the current political policy that we will see an energy policy from America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technology, turn out not to be.
We know for time that famines are result of failure in the food supply.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and food systems, but there will be famines while bad governments.
And finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon was declared war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some highly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support <unk> must actually be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it serves those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition -- like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's no science science fiction mythology as the process of exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be straightforward.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to start <unk> the ideas that you have about confidence.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great shortage of trust, it's a very widespread story.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, I think it gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that there could be increased on others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can go back to <unk> surveys and opinion surveys are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politics, keep inspired by the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still pretty <unk> nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway through.
But is this evidence enough?
What polls opinion polls are, of course, opinion.
What else can you do that?
What you look at are the <unk> attitudes that people are doing some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone will tell you <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at <unk> teachers.
It's probably going to be asking for asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you in some, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain type of official official or type of person, is going to be a uniform in all cases.
I may, for example, I trust a certain master teacher that I know I know to give the class of reading, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my closest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave the whole knowledge of knowledge when we think about trust in more <unk>
I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the real creative level, because they're trying to make the good judgment of inherent judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think in them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say, yes, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters first is not the trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that in order to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the raw raw materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not accountable.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're getting to get to do before we trust.
trust is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of professional institutions, <unk> officials and so forth, that made us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, let's tell you the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> which will look at <unk> in <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we need that the accountability of the accounts that is destined to guarantee to guarantee the <unk> and the testing tests is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they do the work of the people who have to do difficult tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we are <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
We have all that, because of the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if it will be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people that are trustworthy and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
So let's get the task to rebuild the trust, it puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct the trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately is defining because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough for enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it, usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to provide <unk> evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do that?
That makes it every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks says that I can do it without giving <unk>
I take them and get the money, or they change me by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing out is not very hard to <unk>
What people rely on is the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started imagining how we <unk>
And first I created this tool that was embedded in digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the display is its physical body to night.
Designers can lead their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool <unk> the booms.
But the two hands remain still on the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of your hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with cameras cameras to detect their fingers and face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, getting to the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with their hands.
Like windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point on lines or words with the <unk> sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can spread or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we're going to focus on the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system gets the geometry of your body.
So if we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make physical physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would you be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi tutor and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel physicist.
This magnet <unk> it acts like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and mixing mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, what it means that human movements can <unk> and go back and reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and the famous takes Michael Jordan you can reproduce as a physical reality, the times you want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike monitors or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is more fascinating to change the computer part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show us something but to begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to take care of our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if we suppressed that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed that there was only one kind of <unk> path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter if I work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer needs to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult actually took me seriously.
I just got my friends down, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
And I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class was the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one to me. I wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's take the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
The ones that were emerging in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> guilt trap, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture that was also given a place to my reading habit.
It was a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to be out of place because this is what the students in China will learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
<unk> is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked for <unk> why not do it in day everyday life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By Christ, the <unk> are economic, politics and spiritual.
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and duty of Interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of getting lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation of the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from past and present.
I know I won't be happy or powerless ever.
Having a broken dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Her most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, and where happiness comes from.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always have them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first client for <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student at Berkeley.
She was a woman from 26 years called Alex.
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> I dove on the couch in my office <unk> and he said he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to just move the head while it comes to the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I was right.
You start to work after that, you start to work afterwards, you have children later, until the death goes on.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to <unk>
But soon after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys underneath their category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like being married with him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe you get away with the next.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future <unk> all over the place.
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody gets to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, OK. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's fine. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
So this means that eight of 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give it to your life will have been past for when you have 30 and <unk>
People of more than 40, you don't get to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know more than half the Americans are married, or they're coming out of their future partner at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final phase of growth in its <unk> and it is <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change yourself, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility hits its top to 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the moment for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the child's development, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life has a <unk> impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't listen to is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
The journalists named him <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and it is absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> intelligent, like you or your children get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as a career will start a race before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better take the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My dates during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit of an end, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, choosing a couple, and have two or three children in a much smaller period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there's a research that starts to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything once the <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying bacterial cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
They realize that you can't have the son you want to now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was doing? "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> its previous life had been even more difficult.
They tend often in our <unk> but then she gets to the say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and <unk> for nearly the hour.
I had just bought a new book <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words -- "In <unk> please call for <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me, and he said, "Who will be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I didn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that they really would be <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as just to sit while the <unk> of Emma was going.
So, for the next few weeks, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who get rid of that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
For capital capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, that <unk> that company you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> the <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma you to <unk> jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with minds are limited as you know what you know about, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out is almost always coming out of its closest circle.
The new things come from what they call a weak links friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the <unk> work is never <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For last, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when she has a partner and we form her own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better than the age of 30 or even 25 or even 25 and all the 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose to the person who you live now, or you're going to tell you now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you will, and that means being as intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill time with anyone who <unk> you.
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a prime man who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped get a job there.
That work supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who I lived alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, his new family, and sent me a letter to say, "Now people's spaces are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are as an planes coming out of the airport in Los Angeles, who go out somewhere in the West.
Just before you put a slight fit in your trajectory the difference between landing or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, or at 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good shake -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few or even the next generation.
Here's my idea to spread out to all the <unk> who have heard of.
It's as simple as I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I have is the privilege of telling <unk> as I was Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital of identity, using their weak ties to choose your family.
Don't stop what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> work in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City public schools.
And as any teacher, you have tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, they will get grades.
What I called the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance scores were no <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing that well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
After several years of <unk> I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
But what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the West <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to be able to be possible in the competition.
We studied teachers who worked in really hard <unk> working in the very difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We associate with private companies, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it was not social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is embracing your future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a career.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to make me out of determination and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater satisfaction, more likely to graduation, even when they were involved in every single feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of evidence -- even the security results as they were in school.
So it's not just the West Point or the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little thing that we know how little people know about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you empower children?
What should I do to teach kids a good job ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, determination commonly isn't related or it's even related to the immediate measures of talent.
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University, for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because of my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have for the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to begin everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who is to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do that.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw every one of the strokes in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic scholar -- 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic learning.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read signs of traffic traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of the web pages, or the newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you can until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were shouting at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> -- this symbol actually is <unk> the shape of the called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door of the door looks like a couple of <unk> in the old West.
I call a radical <unk>
They are building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person reaches your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundations there.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  And <unk> from remember, because a speaker tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember the fire?
Two boats, a very hot.
Three hundred together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the bright moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun goes out on the horizon.
You put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> you have somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together are <unk>
Three women together are <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
When we use this method, the first eight radical -- will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with each small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in eastern China.
So one sun starts out, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand, to take a magic wand, and bring a magic wand, to you.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of an industrial quiz of <unk> programs.
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took over 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal kid and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl dresses as a guard for the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
Do you use magical shoes to defeat the armies have passed by the evil <unk> computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another single magician of the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did "Star <unk> for a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son of son.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the surveillance level, he had <unk>  So, she slid in the room and he was impressed like a mom of her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but he said, <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be value, resilience and <unk>
I should have a feeling that Luke was one to an army to <unk> the government?
So this with the magician of the Oz of <unk>
How do it make Dorothy their movie?
They do <unk> with all of them and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow out of it, OK?
Why is there so much of the capital of capital F, force in the movies for our children, and so little on the way of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I don't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the Princess <unk> doesn't provide me to navigate the world of adults which is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss.  I think that at the time of the first kiss. I really expected everybody to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be an animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney princess to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, but they guys, they're not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job to teach girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war film.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to appear on classic hours after classical, each of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
As many of you are thinking, this year, finally <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when <unk> came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
Is it very good. Don't let that happen?
Well, almost none of these films happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It has not been roots and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend of mine about the assessment of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you need to do -- in the movie, there's more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the guy who are so much other than <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things to each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I just see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood movie is.
<unk> doesn't mean the test for <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, much of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have profound conversations that have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the things to take a look at the door and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular movies how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then is fine.
But there's a bigger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one of five women says that it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't think music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then they charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this <unk> <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that we have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> are educating our children to keep their own power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children, a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the box, is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite character from "Star <unk> You know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and even more stories where it looked like his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea cookies on the coast of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with time, I was fascinated by <unk>
I began to see ways and patterns that helped me get <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to almost 1,300 miles away along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see by using <unk>
This is a located in the east of Egypt in Egypt called <unk>
And instead, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like <unk> <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the <unk> landscape of construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an ancient city called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient Egypt capital for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient Art <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge continuous <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> miles per mile.
And then the <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered all the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try and find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball gloves <unk>
So we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of the place with very subtle changes.
So we were able to look at where we could get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptians who are doing jobs of <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look at layers of human occupation of human <unk>
Five feet down, under a thick layer, we find a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> layer of a number of hundreds of years that date back from the Empire -- exactly the same period as we think it's <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> jobs and <unk> what it proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like not too much, but when we think about the most common stones in the jewelry of the Ottoman Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't find it <unk> here, but <unk> the place in the near future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I just want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to TED it wasn't founded in 1984 degrees in 1984
Do the ideas actually started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a lot of time and found out from the top.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made of.
Now we would take a group of obese <unk> on bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> career.
I need you to see this <unk>
They are strong <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying around and wheels that go on the wheels of the wheels that end up in the front of the wheels that ends up in the <unk> <unk> the threshold of the gate, <unk>
You know, in the lobby, or what there is on the other side of the door, and you see the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He's waving with the hand.
From the <unk> on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speech.
You can feel your blue fur, you can tickle your nose.
They can smell the <unk> cookie and you get to get in the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter their living room.
It's already in the room, and doing maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on their center, singing <unk> <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a yellow <unk> path from the oven to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len was Len <unk> <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
They put entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could <unk> <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be true of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best memories <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have average memory.
Everybody who deals with this competition says they have normal memory.
And we said, "We have trained to perform these miraculous memory acts using these old techniques invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that he used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that the <unk> academics used to memorize books from <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> how do you have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the competition, and we were standing outside of the competition, and I <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of play live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
The majority of the year the next year is not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what their potential is.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that she didn't even remember that he had a problem with <unk> is awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see what point our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, I read a number of treaties on memory of something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory wasn't such a thing as rare as you might find today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
We have changed, and I would argue that they have changed the cognitive form.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique memory competition.
It's actually not that <unk> there are the skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of University researchers in London invited a group memory group, to the lab.
They wanted to know, to be that it has brains in some ways, structural or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was no really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the guys in control guys with the <unk>
When they put them in a functional MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as they <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> different parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament to the competitive puzzle tournament is driving as a career in where every year comes out somebody with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of playing cards of playing <unk> who is about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that we used at the end are reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says this: I tell two people to remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I come back back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
So what do you say?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity. That's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, and it doesn't really mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
All the other memories that dance on his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
They do well when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when we did that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this about 2.5 thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
I was hired as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you don't brought to a <unk> you get to a <unk>
He stood up <unk> his poem from memory, and he was <unk> and as soon as the <unk> hall.
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting there.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing out there, only survivor, in the front of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where she was sitting around each other.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What you have <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions -- word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory.
If you let me tell you that the first 10 words of history I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you told you to say who I was sitting on the brown <unk> horse in his <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first computer treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do that, in the same way that I would have done it <unk> if you were invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk to would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
That's how <unk> speakers <unk> their <unk> not word for word, that is going to confuse them but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase first <unk> it would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got out of full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a big thing about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, is how to see a lot of people sitting taking exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing happens is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the way to sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or an old school names bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was kind of fun.
I would never have expected that you could do.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to make the ability more and more the ability to create and imagine these images by <unk> comics, <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was really hooked pretty much with this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some safety <unk> covered with tape just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could call it into a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment was coming out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just silver <unk> which work work.
Because they are based on fairly basic principles on how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be built by building <unk> or <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insight, about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of the <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes a kind of deep processing a kind of profound processing that most of them is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what the <unk> I can't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose out of what is already our short <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side, we are going to be so <unk> that we are not even allowed to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'll talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, and so we just went into a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from a <unk> leaders, I was six years old, and I lived there at home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all been walking around the TV. So every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I got married, and I came back in a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was lucky, and I hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
That's right.
Those feelings that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and <unk> of areas -- but of those connections of emotional connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the heart of Protection Protection Agency spend 90 percent of their time under their <unk>
Now, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it in a building built 2.5 thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time, a long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, solid, front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time, and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know that they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> has this round thing -- columns, that leave <unk> what it is, tries to communicate with this <unk> kids, the story values -- history.
But it doesn't have much to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, the other end of the country, the one looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So, how is it possible that in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies -- new solutions for life forms today.
<unk> <unk> and we did so much, we get away from the people.
All of black, this is us, you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other choice.
We need to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols with it.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we do start to experiment with it, we do swing the one back to go ahead and over and over again, we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called the <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on <unk> scale.
Really very hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started bringing those symbols.
It will be <unk> again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that you like and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> and we turned them into <unk> which can be <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns in columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
Very crazy.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy -- they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making swing in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with called <unk>
We <unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques to have a computer design techniques and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are engaged in other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something else happened to happen.
In 1997, this building.
It's called Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when academics and public and public public, they were completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in 2.5 percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle Chicago, Seattle, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these are wild and radical, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them and quickly learned that those forms of culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the major mayors in the world.
So they all believed if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new Millennium Development went to other inner architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all architecture architecture, social media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, for example, how do architecture consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have been walking up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere right now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, 100 more buildings, before you know if that I designed four years ago it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen. Because we're at the top of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> and the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, with media, it starts swing faster and faster, until it will be on both extremes -- almost in <unk> and they actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, among us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional payload for something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings were looked exactly at the finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building left of being just a building, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that one made the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory and in charge of these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians from <unk>
If that building was built today, first to take the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded bombarded by examples of experiment, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> who can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and different drawings, and one is no longer a <unk> audience that is not accepting something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get stuck with the architecture.
That means that the highlight of a style to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick brick based on ideas of what was a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings will be replaced by the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sport or <unk> or even one can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East <unk> East New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we built.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings are not just reflecting our society, but they give them way to the most unequal spaces of local libraries and the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this very cool way, typical of the children in a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
So apparently, your friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think, when about doing this?
How is it that all of a sudden we're not going to be happy with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> he's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
He's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, although her mom tells her all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or classmates say, he doesn't believe who they believe.
So a video of her himself, publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has been over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy healthy <unk> that gets these answers to one of the most vulnerable life in their life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, in their vast majority of teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young as <unk>
As a mother said, "It's like a party in his room all <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand is <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of things that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between a life online and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what's rigged it <unk>
What is the greatest thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> star stars and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, development of their physical capacities.
Six of 10 girls would rather do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how we value society and the work of labor development.
31 percent, almost one out of every three teenagers are not interested in the classes of class.
One in five are not attending at all classes at the days when they don't feel comfortable in it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think that you are good enough, specifically if you don't think you're slow enough, you have a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it turns out regardless of what these young people weigh up.
So, in order to be good of course, we're talking about how you see you not as you really are.
<unk> on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in healthier diets that can lead to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption, and drug drugs -- diet <unk> aesthetic relationship to early age, and without protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs it billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to an interview interview in a day that they don't feel safe in the way they see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that happen?
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to develop the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I stayed very impressed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it.
So we have to make sure that the program that our children continue to have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for anybody willing to provide a body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but address this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
We challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count with the input, of our political <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people out of what they are, not as you see them.
We can all start by making responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can encourage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow their own person, valuing it, diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people into really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never known as the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in your mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
He <unk> her <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats away. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was allowed by not to have long legs -- <unk> more skinny, a <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were able to do this, and we would make his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images are holding us together.
But let's take our kids the truth.
You know, the way you look at it is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that the love of those who are and for what they do, and because they make us feel.
And they went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And we put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that small <unk> of a year of age today, they become safe enforcement agents themselves in their own morning.
So let's do it.
Last November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense Development <unk>
To <unk> initially they were naive, but being inmate in other charges -- in the company of others, they started planning on the attacks of about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans were driven by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't figure it out.
Later on, he would be convicted of their involvement in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> an American mother, an primary school teacher in the two made the best possible for me to give me a happy child.
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
By experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to want to wish the same things in life.
However, in every religion, in all of the humans, there is always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we need to use all the possible media for everybody to live as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat up with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to train on Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point to the target for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot around, I gave it to the little orange light on the goal and, for surprise of all, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle went into the other and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a father, such a son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they found as funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to put a <unk> <unk> in the northern parking lot of the World Trade Center parking lot into the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability for my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of friendships.
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone whether it was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the face of the class that I was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not developed social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was raised by raised people, <unk> people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or his religion.
So how could the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test for my thinking, was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence -- because I had been victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt very much passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the convention, I found out that one of the kids who had done friendship, was Jewish to her.
I took several days to go out to light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I never had had a Jewish friend and frankly, I felt very proud to be able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job when I got a summer job in Bush -- an amusement park.
I met people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all the gay were bad ones.
By the way, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly in the way I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is a homosexual but I know what it is to be tested by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart asked me to be honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In a lot of ways, he became my figure out at a moment where I was desperately excited about.
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was going to change my way of thinking, and she told me something that keep in my heart forever, as he's alive.
She looked at me tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and she said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope somebody's one day, who is to be able to lead to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which even though I was obsessed with this violent anti-Israeli ideology I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak up against those things, like rejection of my father's actions.
With this simplicity I put me here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you all very much.
At this point, there is a film that is projected in its minds.
It's an incredible film film.
It's 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like the moments of your childhood that we project to your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths about being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a physical film, you, you, tea and you.
There's nothing to get more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I don't have certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of anything in our lives, it would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we just just robots that we need to make the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, no one knows the answers to those questions.
<unk> that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness science.
<unk> for nature, is objective an objective of it.
<unk> for nature, is subjective power.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, we got that vision.
psychology was not really inspired behavior, the neuroscience of the human brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science, the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a blooming of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has also fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of wonderful work that he presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience will answer some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain brain areas do areas of the brain and what they do is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's no really easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does an inner movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like the <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work -- they adapt to how they behave and <unk> living organisms, all of them are questions about how the target works.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about how we speak, how we play <unk> they are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied by an immersive experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, is actually not a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific student.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that will work. For a long time, I was hitting the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stand up at this point.
We have a wonderful explanation, great. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, it's kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the film subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what we have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain functions, the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a purely purely <unk> theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just denial that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that we have -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists are sometimes taking some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
It <unk> fundamental laws that <unk> them as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they think of the fundamental way, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, US, it discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space -- time, mass laws, laws of Newton. Then he applied the basic laws of <unk> and he applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find out with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- fundamental ideas -- time, charge, then load for logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the space, the time, the physical processes.
So physicists are sometimes saying that we want the fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find very simple laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only the humans, the dogs, mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think about me, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking about perhaps photons may have any element of crude feeling, <unk> some <unk> precursor element of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like the others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems to be more continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think about with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
So there's always processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, the complex consciousness.
<unk> of simple, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with a mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which calls <unk> which measures the extent of information integrated into a system.
And I mean, <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a middle degree of information integration of information, just quite significant, degree of consciousness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there will still be a different awareness of zero.
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have been observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
But it will look the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As Stephen Hawking, as Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be <unk> but they can be used to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious ethical and ethical consequences and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I wasn't supposed to eat anything that has consciousness, then it must be a vegan.
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think that I think, well, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms, and marketing, moral is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethic of development of computer systems and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or to a local level, an integrated group -- like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a collective collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer at the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing -- than the second thing is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
Everything was quite normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get it to an award of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a problem.
She's not actually done anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low-performing profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, yes. How contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be able to be an achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school at a high school of <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class 11 months of <unk> a guy raised my hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people were in the wheels, they talk about things to go back to school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability as a inspiration.
And we are, and it's not the fault of the boy, it is true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there for <unk>
And in fact, I'm on this stage on this stage to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you to kill you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to get it up.
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and live with a disability makes it remarkable.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make a phenomenal question.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
It may be that you've seen one, from the girl without drawing with a pen <unk> by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration from.
And I use the porn term <unk> already that we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disability for the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, because so bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that they have been dealing with weird <unk> to express that you think I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I stood up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images will inspire people to benefit from people with the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually hard.
Let's get a few things.
But the things that we have, not the things you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was given to the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled because of society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned the best of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of the commons.
They simply are using their bodies their bodies best of their ability.
So it's really fair to be in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> of <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge your phone battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a very stairs has never made it to become a <unk>
Never.    So <unk> on a television screen will not make the subtitles for <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 10-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> of nothing for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11 degree of high school at a high school of Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
The disability will not make us <unk> but questioning what you know about it is that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and football with the <unk>
And what is the average rate of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just answer one of those questions, so please don't get over.
When people think of reality, they think about "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
Really augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because today's augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing -- <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of trying to relate to everything in being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So you get some videos to show you what Google looks like, under the shell, and give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is an asteroid climbing up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
<unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You might have noticed that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from Washington University.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more than being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, will be their favorite players, and you have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how do we get the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that many of you already know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not cheap enough.
And I'm going to show you why I have this video with this video.
Man: Oh, great.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man on a roller coaster in his life.
What will the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with your arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan
When he can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball behind the network?
What will their experience is when you go from one mountain to more than 100 an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we achieve reality <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when they <unk> the <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> in 1994, the <unk> of the field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine you're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next play shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have in front of you, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
<unk>
They just go out to the field and they don't.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate losing games.
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
Reality reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do it?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is the send to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
They're going to have information <unk>
This is going to give the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just for nerds.
It's also going to be for <unk> Who would have thought?
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
They put the ball and <unk>
<unk> a very open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that an defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't have the <unk> but the <unk> system will give you.
Let's go through the area of protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there is a big deal.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you land, but the receptor sees it in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
They <unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have continued to play it from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do you lots of people you see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
You want to be your favorite player.
Reality reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this one to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is it also for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions we make, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently joined me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the extreme end of the South County <unk> which includes the <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to the beautiful view of San Francisco, the Indian Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is no practical nor <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been transferred to each of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass underneath it <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The shock breaks the bones, some of which will make vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that don't normally get stuck in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of this suicide method will realize <unk> death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have to be before they get their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darkest time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, official officials are trained in the new <unk>
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the <unk> of <unk> last year when he gets a call from a possible man sitting in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a <unk> bridge officer.
Jason was just 32 years and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try and kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology called <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on to the right, and it was.
This kind and smart boy in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been order.
<unk> damage, affect a lot of people.
So I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved to be <unk>
What <unk>
What about that?
In my experience, not only to talk, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't fear <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front can save your life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read him his letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email about just a couple of days, and he's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing it more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> game with his father on the <unk>
He never got there.
I called the <unk> cop and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and reported that the car car was down the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day of the day.
Thank you very much to fight for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before bad without having a real infectious disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck is this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean for hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a possible man in the sidewalk near the north tower.
I had my smile on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and half a half later, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to that lane to give the life another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> he was going to take it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But he said, "What was it that made me <unk> and give it to the hope and life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I will <unk>
I stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have this letter with me, and I would like to take it up.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th of March, and you are one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
I went back to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those <unk> traits -- but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We give God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she write, <unk> when I visited the General of San Francisco in San Francisco at night, you have the patient.
I know I had to get it back.
Kevin is a <unk> father.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was killed with poison.
That act, in spite of finishing his own pain, theft of the opportunity to meet me.
This is what has suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: you sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents in which I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand in three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one you leave from side the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only to connect <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge we do, is something that every single one and every one of us must work for doing.
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question you ask you, how do you get in that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had had the dream I had had since a child.
My outside finally got to my inner reality, with my inner self.
For reasons for me to go back later, when I look at this picture I'm thinking, you know, you got it, you know, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that <unk> I'm just getting started.
We are all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin into the color of your skin or because of the belief that around us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is mine.
I became like <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance of my genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, I was always wearing this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, my hair is a <unk>
I knew then how to do it?
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but we now know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never got to share my story, not because I thought that being a bad thing, but because of how the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who tell me like am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when he was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if he <unk> she was <unk> out of the expense <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in bathroom suit -- I won in <unk> and he was third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was of queen of women's women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when I went to the remote provinces of the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that I passed my request from the green card that I could go to live to the U.S.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you teach the United States, you can change your name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was to put two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied me when I was in Thailand to the 19 years.
It is curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated cities in Thailand -- sophisticated and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, your identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> lived in his truth, but that <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who were <unk> and he stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more <unk> than 20 percent of <unk>
My deepest truth took me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. So thank you first, to thank all my <unk>
I was in my support network, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I lived to young women who have <unk> and some times, when they called me and they told me that their parents could not embrace it, I took my mom and she called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just for gender, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everyone was assigned to a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes a block, and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very cute <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who he knows for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in the 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the <unk> National Prize for peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I took a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born a little girl, their birth will not be saved.
It's not welcome, not by your father, not for your mother.
The neighborhood comes back, gives you the mother and no one bought the father.
And a mother would get a lot for having a child.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he was <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only did the mother <unk> but a daughter was newborn when it comes up, she suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and the <unk> to their siblings.
Up to the age of 12 in a way, it has a good life.
It can be <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you keep out of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if they were going to take the code of that <unk> honor, it could even kill them.
And it's interesting that this <unk> of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members in the family.
So this brother <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
They are supposed to be <unk> and that accepts the decisions of their father and mother and the elderly decisions -- even if he doesn't like.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> it with an old man, you have to <unk> because you don't want to be <unk>
If the very young, very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to his daughter and the same lesson to her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I went on, I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter like this.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, I went back in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I should be <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the young child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
A <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for its future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were going to take the ballot form of <unk> and it was in the relative to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
I would sit down with me when my friends came to me.
I was encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to stick it in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught the students, forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomena.
It was lethal for human rights and, in particular, for women's rights.
He was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
It was a million, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have about those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he was lifted up and he got up the right to education.
He wrote a day for the blog of the BBC, was offered her itself for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and January January of 2012, he was shot in his head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would lie to my ear to my wife -- <unk> <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
I put your life in the game because of the cause of peace, because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe headaches because his facial <unk> was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that goes into the face of my wife.
But my daughter never stopped.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please do it not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
They put brothers and brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights of children and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when your job doesn't go.
You fight their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my partner, which has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut his wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the brain science has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I talked about here about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still like smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what a number to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if you didn't take anything, you would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and <unk> of chemicals, and try to get them to stay alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the <unk> dose because there's really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to test with different <unk> and I was shocked to see how small changes in the dose changed dramatically my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, and I tried to have a typical chemical doses for a man of <unk> and I was amazed to see how my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've known several types of like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of the past.
It turned out to be an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had to the front, and it just doesn't happen like this.
So I couldn't deal with it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do is, since then I have better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my ideas of ideas.
<unk> thinking about always in images, and that became my key cue -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you get to make new ideas and recreating experiences.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who <unk> this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works to me, is a simple one, for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the thinking and <unk> thinking.
So, after several years, I managed to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great <unk> mental <unk> really sophisticated and very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mentally <unk> from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a film director was able to use its imagination only to drive the world that has to <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music in your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way the creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to make this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups that are leading in neuroscience.
Both of them used a functional functional MRI image, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the middle of the brain shows the brain scanning of that same individual as they <unk> seeing that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is pretty good.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine to see that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn out the brain waves in the visual <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, he showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they <unk> their brains to create a great pool of reaction to the video sequences.
And then they showed them a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain data from the scan of the scanning thing to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're right close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see a image, and when you imagine that same image, you create the brain the same <unk>
This was taken through the brain scanning brain scanning brain brain cells today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times to get a deeper look at it.
How did we do that?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new encryption techniques to images -- even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the <unk> first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is to have bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> just offer little improvements in the resolution of not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of magnets bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with arrangements slightly different as making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to do really big, right?
However, most recent advances in <unk> and brilliant and brilliant solutions in coding and <unk> in the insects and FM radio often in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field or a magnetic field -- the chemical patterns -- which is structured to the wireless frequencies.
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split up in layers, our rising knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid <unk> but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even neural activity -- this is the dream.
We will be able to put our ideas into a direct form to the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few options that will open up this door.
But anyway, they choose a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
Let me talk to you tonight about getting out of closet, and not just in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet may be telling you some person for the first time you love it, or say to someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you're going to be through in life.
So I'm going to be a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
So many years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through various phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope that by the <unk> of my <unk> and I had my head <unk> I would make a little bit of -- I asked a kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there was a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father named <unk> the newspaper and the mother launched a cold, looking at his son.
But I would say anything, and I would say it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to come up with the female issues on the table.    I had <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," which we <unk>
So I took it up and I went down my eyes and my backs of a four year-old girl with a pink dress in looking at what is not a challenge for <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
So I took it down to a little bit of it, and I got out of <unk> about her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like the guy in a boy, and I saw <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to wear a rose dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
I am more than a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. No, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were putting one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what the walls are.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you 100 reasons why I get out of my journey, it was harder than getting out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who have given you to online banking is harder than to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than telling your son of five years that you're going to be <unk>
There is no more difficult, only is the hard.
We have to stop to classify what is hard to make us feel better about what difficult for someone to make us feel better or worse in relation to our beliefs -- and we should just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel safety, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that I had a horse tail, a dress and <unk>
It was not the gay <unk> prepared to fight any child in four years that would fit into the coffee.
I was frozen because of fear, <unk> in a corner of my <unk> <unk> my gay grenade and moving only one muscle is the scariest thing ever ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers with whom I've spent my entire life trying to not survive, and now the world would turn around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable Sydney <unk> was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my voice and I was suffering from honor, in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and I finally got to one where the friends of my parents' parents, people who knew I was doing years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women screamed at Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay story had begun.
Have you ever heard you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our <unk> <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who we were telling us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing his support, desperately to get me to know that I was from my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like the hard conversations remain without being my strong point.
Ask anybody with the ones that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to come out of any closet.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor, and I was ready for the struggle.
If you want someone to be educated -- others need to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that you're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate their truth.
It will never be done by that.
And some of you can go out of safe, <unk> so they have done, but it's never comfortable with what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that thing in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark journey, and I'm going to get a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the history of what intelligence, an productive example has been the famous <unk> quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether an submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critique of computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's step back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth and the neuroscience of the Earth, but you have incredible telescopes, and you can observe incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that you don't have any concept of Earth's intelligence on Earth, would you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that we prescribe the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a few years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the future freedom skills to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, for several years now, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, it acts in the end to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or maintain the open options with a physical force, with the diversity of potential accessible, accessible, Yeah, to an imminent time time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
Now intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open.
And so, having this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It will make the level of human intelligence.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should be given to the more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> connection, between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior not only is correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find it in.
Amazingly, <unk> could spend multiple animal intelligence, play games, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without the wrong thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
So just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave myself a goal.
He just decided for his balance to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and science technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate by throwing opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that they can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has an interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections in a social network where our friends are constantly falling in, and they keep the very successful network as well.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering they successful and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, it's widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated <unk> negotiating series of <unk> <unk> by increasing assets under their management management.
This risk of risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of <unk> cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of a single equation, that leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion in the use.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion to the other way.
It's not that machines first get smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all contrast, that the impulse to take control of all the future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
I often ask me, "How do you get to get away from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to get to the descendants of that statement to help them build artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoiding restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The NASA NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is where the Earth is just one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that will come to us.
The data collected by Kepler show the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
In <unk> this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light they receive from their <unk>
At the time, this gives us clues about if these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure trove of potentially our own planet -- our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now is disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a scientist in weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the quest of life in the universe I can tell you that the more we look for planets like Earth, more than our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the <unk> planet, and the planets that we know best -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a world potentially habitable world that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface into the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites as the <unk> mission -- take samples of the atmosphere <unk> and try to understand how Mars Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business is now offered not only short space flights but also <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the surface and the highest places on the Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets will get a big and sad deal, the implication and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly habitable Earth.
As much as I like the exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to safeguard humanity is like imagine that the captain of Titanic will tell us that the party actually will be later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the preservation of Earth is not <unk>
No, they are actually expensive in the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces of <unk> in the hostile and behavioral spaces of land, maybe we can even meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment. The paradox of <unk>
So many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me, in account that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence for alien life tests so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations are becoming advanced enough to be able to consider to continue to live between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we can do this development.
It's just arrogant to think that only colonization <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, they can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dinner table where there were <unk>
So quickly, I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all <unk>
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it up, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff to go night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I went out of my passport and my suitcase.
They were expensive, but they certainly don't have more expensive than one <unk> at the middle night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I would come up with a good time.
I'm a profession, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rate -- <unk> the adrenaline levels, and <unk> the thinking.
And when I arrived at the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in the place, that <unk> that bad things happen.
Or at least, if things happen, bad things -- the likelihood that it is a total catastrophe,
So I started thinking about that, but even a month later my thoughts are not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about he broke the window, and he had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes out and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains that you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you might get out wrong, then it tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not that evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you get a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish are, where fish are <unk> the trees that are <unk> where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of the <unk> and yet they could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose your car keys, glasses of reading and <unk>
So at home, you know, a place for the keys, a hook along the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer.
For their glasses of reading, a particular <unk>
If you look at a place and you're <unk> with it -- your stuff will always be there when you get them.
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card card license, you choose your drive, passport, <unk> for him to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases off.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face to a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very specific medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all making medical decisions, and in fact to make financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take out of what would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack, heart disease.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> medications in the world today, it's probably likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yeah, let's get the <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that is supposed to be asking for the most physicians that most physicians don't want to talk about, and companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery on any medical procedure before they help one person.
And you should think about what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's a fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't really understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works just about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needed to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help an person?
300.
This according to the research of the researchers called <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently by <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a heart attack, whether or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one likelihood in 300 of my <unk>
Why did not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody else.
But then you have to ask for an statistical statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And these include things that include muscle pain and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they're now thinking, "The five is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, underwater.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to manufacture the string of reasoning on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of them have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to leave the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say that you should not have a <unk>
I'm just saying that you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
Real medical ethic is part of the principle of informed consent informed it.
We have right to having access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men in the age of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it's 49 surgery for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case, are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects on only one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make that look at the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the spot.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least one is trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut up a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face with a predator -- you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get lunch lunch so anything that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
So the idea is to think about the future how those things might be, to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize the harm, or to prevent things bad were going on in the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor I settled on a combination along the door, with a key to the entry door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't met and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm managing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical name.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
And four extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can I ever have a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language language came in during the 1960s and over time, mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, is like I lived in a foreign country, following blindly their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and make the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people answers.
So I've been learned, for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure we don't have the <unk> in the <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, about what you're going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
They are going to be <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic apartment there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces of different <unk> and while I was coming from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that point, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk>
I realized it doesn't have to be that way.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that well that you don't just experience through your ears.
I can feel it in a <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that they had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was just struck by the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me, just like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to today's society.
So in school, in the workplace, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to ask for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan for a very high interest rate.
If you're not going to continue on this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic <unk> <unk> in the music world.
And I was amazed by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note -- you can't capture and express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two of them are very <unk> and highly <unk> what it means that subtle changes can affect everything as much as the sound of the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into lots of different <unk>
If you take a different <unk> for every finger while it touches the piano, the movement of the body movement, the speed, the speed, the way of the hand, and so as you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if you get <unk> just a button at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a way to express a clear concept or the idea of <unk>
If just a button would change the <unk> it would create completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started to think, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you fold it over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all day."
If you get it off, and you look at the speed, visually as it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can say about <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expresses in <unk> and how far the distance in the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present present is getting closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time at a time again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think it would automatically be <unk>
You see <unk> right, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of your hands on top.
Now we're going to do so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one. Please take it again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Now look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen on the head and the chest but convey very different meanings here.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> has no sounds, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And perhaps people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to take you to open your ears, open your eyes, participate in our culture and experience about our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can do everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bamboo bubble or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults are also going to be <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning the other people.
The country -- now I'm an adult and I teach civil school and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, <unk> <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those giant ocean.
So together with my students, with age ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this <unk> of work with <unk> so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave you with my students' imagination.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to convince them in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids get a lot with the robots.
Then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform lamps and cameras online, and they put it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get an extra estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I would take this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would get it to it.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news news, you get to get the Internet, and you get into this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you drink -- it's the water that you <unk> the water where you live.
You can also see that water is brown and oil and oil are also <unk> and when everything <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be attached to all sorts of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
So we put this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I can investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it <unk> various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> crops in the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people were killed in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power near water.
And today, according to the reports of a thousand tons still are leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution for <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has pretty secure, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become <unk> every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course I didn't believe them, the parents don't do it.
But every night you go down to the center of <unk> here you see the use of masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take work seriously, but they did that because they are going to have to live with the <unk> their entire life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust is going down from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an invasive estimate.
But based on that we organized a civil expedition the closest the nuclear power to date.
We can zoom in to 1.5 miles of the nuclear economy, and with the fishing aid of the area, we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking device as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with very simple open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so that we find an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, so you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of kids can become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are <unk>
We can't afford to protect children from the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists, creators, <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to care about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different <unk> design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fighting for being free.
The <unk> was only <unk>
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we take all the information that would take for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production of mass.
The assembly lines have <unk> a world in parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of parts of <unk> with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with continuous <unk>
The skins of the back are thicker with little <unk>
You act mostly like filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, there's no <unk>
It is a system that gradually shapes its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect at the work between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My work at its most simple level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, coming out of assembly and getting up to growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why was it not possible this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we never had had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet your minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, products, structures and tools through scale, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a force that is not very far <unk> to print <unk> buildings and graphics in the nanoscale made of genetically altered <unk>
Here we have <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is in the unique size to shape light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a fashion fashion fashion fashion with <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second skin made of one single piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator <unk> we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to these high resolution and <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural environment, and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, shapes its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> the material ownership of it.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts of nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me stories about the Bible -- and one of them was stuck with me, and it came to define a lot of what it matters.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
So for that first tree tree, there would be no difference between trunk, and there are branches and <unk>
All the tree was <unk>
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design be if things were made in a single part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> in the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could <unk> their <unk> we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We asked a lot of seed husks -- the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard from <unk> <unk> and transparent.
To print the structures at the big scale, it was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of one material three feet long, 100 percent recyclable percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves it to dry to find a natural way in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria engineered to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition from <unk> to mesh -- and if it got even more, even windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, and so abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of shrimp steel into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the soil, help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> board, we made our own new <unk> new forms of life created <unk> and made it in <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, you get two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like a tract <unk> that will help us build these bacteria and to engage their way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material as the functionality of <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> we have more transparent channels.
This system <unk> <unk> when you get away from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life within your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We're middle-aged creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter of matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin <unk> our skin tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think about this as a way of editing the biology.
I call this the material ecology of it.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer <unk> <unk> material.
You also know that nature does not do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly immersive architecture a home inside which we <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, comparing those fibers to each other.
And this happens over scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we were going to <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape of the <unk> the structure of <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
Often it <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing <unk> and we put us on our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> to more dark and cool areas why we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, and they are going to <unk> silk <unk>
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> <unk> silk worms online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to stick with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> the biological silk of <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion on our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, we had <unk> silk worms <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A robotic <unk> through a robotic arm, the other <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to bring products to products and the buildings around us to form a ecology of two materials, designers must join these two visions in the world.
What it takes us from turn, of course, at the beginning.
This is a new era of design, a new era of design, which leads us from a design inspired by nature to an nature inspired by us, for the first time, we make ourselves charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some type of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English and the art and the art and made websites -- I played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for spending a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to let it.
But then I got bored with something else, something totally different, and I'm going to do it in it, and I just let me absorb and I feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it.
But then I'd like to find something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing in a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my passions, passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that it caused me as much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for nothing.
I was concerned to be afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to ask myself then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> learned from culture.
We asked ourselves first "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would expect.
It's considered a naive question to create nice answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow different forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of before it takes us the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream with what they might be, is not inspired to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does right now, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though you have a good deal, you may be <unk> and say, "Oh, the cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The whole notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of destiny.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that bring their curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone as one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath by that to say.
It could help if you divide it in three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
They can also use other terms that we think about the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
In the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was well at, at multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You have any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapting to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers who are <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualizing data, travel, and it was math and design, when we found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of the unique idea by its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
From there comes the new ideas.
And <unk> them with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is learning fast.
When we <unk> it up, we go to it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be lucky, by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to each new area that we are rarely built.
<unk> <unk> is a full time and full-time writer.
As a young girl, <unk> an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it turned into a writer, <unk> was a financial photographer.
He had to learn the simplest sales mechanics when their <unk> and this ability to write a compelling test for the editors.
<unk> is a waste of time to go to what you would tell you even if at the end of the end.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform into anything that you need in a given situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes one of the videos, another book designer designer -- sometimes a <unk> sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse roles depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Magazine defined adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster minds to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need to need creative creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They come from belly knowing because they wanted to be neurosurgeons <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams make up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and put in practice ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to deal with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely is encouraging them to just be more like their <unk>
And once you said this, if there's one thing you can carry out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep their curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
We need the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> was taken to a psychiatric skeleton.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> because unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, he did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and they found strange <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If we had been living today, we couldn't give her more help than that he <unk> he gave her years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for the <unk> and much more.
But little has been made in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, we will affect 150 million which, by the way, will include many of you.
If you wait to live 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that it will spend their <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be wanted to take Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is lost in Alzheimers disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs will increase a five times in 2050, by 2050, as we get the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's made relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death from all around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow on.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of itself.
The United States government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's despite the fact that the fact that Alzheimer's disease costs us more Alzheimer's and cause an annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us even, scientists, business with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there is only to look a picture of a healthy person's brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to celebrating a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused significantly reducing the life expectancy and it's always deadly as well.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots come out in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other forming groups that can form large <unk> <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
You could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you want, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> the physical <unk> engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that you get into each other inside of them, like human Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that they are <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope that can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we will, we can get it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, for scientists for scientists and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat the cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, they're often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
So we had this article in the Hubble Love column from the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience by testing it a night in the last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers will be transferred to get 36 increasingly personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or skill, what would you be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you ever heard another person?
And <unk>
<unk> are getting more personal and more personal and more personal ones.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> Tell your partner what you like it or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't have ever known.
And when I came across this study a few years ago, a really thing that struck me about attention -- that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So, I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and  and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the political column a few months later.
That was published in January, and it's now August, so I guess some of you will probably wonder, they follow still yet.
And the reason I think this is <unk> this is because they've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had tried to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually about my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand views.
And that came up with a good load of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as they gave no idea.
The article ran on a Friday Friday night, and I was on Saturday, this happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, they had been called the "Today Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million views, and I was saying something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is foster trust writing about understanding of their own experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were calling or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were always doing the same question: still keep together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship on an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for St. <unk> which included the readers of the readers to prove the studio in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this was being very close to my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both made a public emergence together.
We had TV interviews, and they <unk> orders for us two.
I think that I was afraid to become the icons of the <unk> of the process of <unk> a range for the one that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know whether the study worked, they wanted to know whether they really work, they wanted to know whether it was really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt, especially that people stated the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there was the goal of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at interpersonal approach, among university students, using what they <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer after doing that, several <unk> studies, also used the Tunisian protocol -- <unk> <unk> as a rapid way to create trust and interaction among strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of political policy?
The original version of the story, which I <unk> the past summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately, he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get rid of the person who you <unk>
Well, he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to do better than test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
There was that relationship since I had 20, what was almost all my adult life, and he was my first true love and he had no idea about how or she could live without him.
So I took back to science.
And it was all that I could find about romantic love science, and I expected that that could be in a certain form of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just research for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really like <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is an individual, not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> endlessly by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee of people when they wanted to know whether they were still together.
The story told the news about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in order to somehow mitigate some of the risk -- and this is a very scary story because in love with us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still keep together?
And their content with a response or No.
So more than a question, let's ask us to make questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How to stay in in love when things got <unk> and how do you know when to cut and cut out and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with doubt about your partner?
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more nuanced conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year, and I apply a study that is designed to create romantic love, we will be <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> Love didn't happen.
They have fallen in love with love -- because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of the reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that choice was supposed to be.
I didn't think that we would have both to take that decision, and how many times will I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always pick up or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, and I have chosen to love someone who was so generous, kind of fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't believe really.
And what you want, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy implicit ending at the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and is <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian <unk> and in a way, I got like a <unk> of the forest.
New York City makes a while.   Something really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I took a <unk> ticket a dollar, and a fork in somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our sort of physical species, for example how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has a lot because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going to go from a field camp and make and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took out all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> I was going to do the style by Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking it could be <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of a way that it seemed that it goes out of size, as if it was that you would get the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add some electronic elements, few strange bottles that I was finding out of the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow by drawing just like drawing around a dead body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of individuals who were <unk>
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend at dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size resin with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs about 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go out of the world of representation -- this <unk> mesh of <unk> <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge in Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while from the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit of a story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> of <unk> a long tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
Their tail ends up in a eyeball <unk> made from 1986.
You've got them <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards in the terrorists.
Very close to your time.  This brings me to my final project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material will be diagnosed or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in form of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they divide it.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> the chest can be <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it does -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, a musician, a <unk> an <unk> a museum, a student arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
We have the box and all the people inside hits each other.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you have a <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of religion doesn't work.
We're all very made out of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when it hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first passes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> system for any drug to get effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and to increase the heart cells.
But they are also known for their side effects of side effects on its own negative side because in the time they take it to the blood stream -- it will be <unk> and worse for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's more important, in the <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't reach easily in the blood bloodstream, of the patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption disruption -- the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a treatment for life managed to run by their life.
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> make the drug treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery in diabetes they can be used for anything else -- including <unk> transport drugs.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or <unk> extremely small holes, which open and closes almost the cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You ask, "How do that happen?
We sent a little laser and powerful beam on the cellular membrane for HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk>
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How do that happen?
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head -- a <unk> that goes down the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to total HIV eradication of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways of encouraging violent involvement of violent participation at nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to nonviolent comparisons to
I do fieldwork in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors.
For instance, of the <unk> peace agreements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what it motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are doing it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and not armed with armed policies.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
Human groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent obsession against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
It's multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking multitasking
It was a complex machinery of communication stations, radio channels on TV channels and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed book magazine in English and published to <unk>
Local groups also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but by using business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funding, to recruit us better and build their brand.
Robust groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Robust groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not pay security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan <unk> by the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be viewed by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an increased price rate for the population.
But in general, we provide social services -- it means filling a empty gap a <unk> gap by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 from Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps up by the government, and they emerge as armed groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated the sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can actually <unk> it as something contrary to a state.
How is a group like <unk>
So it's part of a territory, running all of their function, collect the trash, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without <unk> and the <unk> and the smaller ones are the states, like in the Middle East, the larger <unk> and they fill that gap.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in tools.
<unk> that government gap has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and strengthen peace.
If we better understand today's groups, we'll better understand what incentives offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battles, but we won't give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that of the government of the government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the <unk> label <unk> it would be <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad but pretty bad.
And therefore I was struck as a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and they hated sex. Like that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated in the world and the anger, in particular, seems like perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in the <unk> who could be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word taboo and unpleasant word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who ask too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and he can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
We would have the same exact same for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as being free of gender or violence.
We have right to use in easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide on our bodies, without the need for <unk> <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, whether of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and much more.
We have to realize these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths is <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession again.
When you go to work, I'm listening to rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades the <unk> women and offends me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of yin yang -- it's amazing.
I actually got your <unk> shirt with your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am totally <unk> by my musical connection.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects -- the trash collection of garbage care and the maintenance collection of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy <unk>
Some of my <unk> are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's her choice, and I am not who to support him.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their kids, they will give that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically economically vulnerable when they <unk>
We have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, and gay and gay and <unk> favor of white, <unk> of middle and high class.
<unk> if that's good Feminism is a very bad feminist feminist boy.
It also happens by the next one: <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we will make it all right.
And when we get rid of the <unk> with a lot like the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think, <unk> that <unk> before you try to put up there.
We were women, particularly the innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> because I'm afraid that <unk> is not able to be able to be able to fulfill the <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk>
In the Video: Music <unk> in <unk> in <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to look at this pop star and embrace it openly and do the women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began with endless arguments if they were <unk> it was or not a feminist.
He <unk> his contention instead of just believing the word of an adult and <unk>
<unk> perfection -- because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go far beyond sensible and <unk> <unk> to <unk> Feminism of any woman, <unk> until it was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive Feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We have to recognize our <unk> to give the question, will go to action and be a little bit more brave.
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists to be happier that they would be happier by providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve to and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> <unk> and I also want to grow up in a world.
And where they were overwhelmed by the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is dealing with sexual violence against women as a sport, and they have the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their companions like <unk> <unk>
In any case, the men, especially young men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish it in your project, participating in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include enough number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range.
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also engage them to be even more like us to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the can.
Because we are not a <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, people in the power of and music and music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make big decisions, more brave to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage -- well, well, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because the ancient <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
So my voice, and after everything I didn't care about to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was overwhelmed with a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant living in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and socialism also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue that <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad speaker -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need to be a little bit courageous, when you need to be <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had measles out there to be seen or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that measles who may be lousy for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily infectious diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed science on autism and vaccines and <unk> viruses, and marked a fraud <unk> by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe the most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put them in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and whenever I had heard of talking about her creating their entire professional life without seeing one case.
Over decades, estimates of prevalence continued stable stable only three or four children for every 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funding as <unk> <unk> refer to routinely autism as an epidemic as if I could make it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you are not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control and what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers of <unk>
But that kind of language doesn't cut a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of her two years, the visual contact of his son.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be asked why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than to do with slow progress and <unk> of science than the power of the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a children's psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> <unk> at Johns <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> a private worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
You could fun for hours by waving the hands before their faces, but they were prey to <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
The base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1970s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, declared that there was less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while taking references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not secret, because the <unk> criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give you that diagnosis of children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine out of 10 children sent to their office to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've stayed very carefully in a refrigerator that we don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic would be able to distinguish 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, affirming things like kids were simply telling us what they had heard of their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic kids were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970 that the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive involved in London, thought that the theory of mothers -- <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a big autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl in a support for support, no special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service in Health that they needed more resources for autistic kids and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
We have a study of prevalence in autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb in London called <unk> to try to find autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse and diverse ones.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for astrophysics, on dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In another way, these kids don't <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Early on, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have heard of these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
I didn't even have a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German -- and he would take it to her.
The document provides an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a <unk> school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with <unk> exercises with music, and the kids were still their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a <unk> disability for life that required essential and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and they took to help in the methods of education that were especially right for them.
And basically, <unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural <unk> like the awkward social scientist and the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, in science and art, a hint of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes were located in <unk> by the limited model of <unk> for one wider and <unk> model.
These changes were not on a broken bag.
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> recognition recognition -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> psychologists and parents around the world knew what was autism.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose the autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were hoping that they were waiting for the way that people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple powerful history and <unk> credible history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, is right, autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they're the puzzles for solving new medical breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the strains of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of a human operating systems.
The fact that a PC does not work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to standard standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
No doubt, people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in understanding the teachers, employers who are ability, <unk> communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we move into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
